	- The People of the [[Locations/Regions/Velum Custodia/Bal Ascetica/Settlements/Scatterscale Steppe/Scatterscale Steppe\|Scatterscale Steppe]] kill what was, unbeknownst to them, a guardian dragon. They use the body to forge new weapons. They harvest it for mana. Word spreads. People who fear dragons without reason arm themselves. People who seek profit, arm the people who fear dragons. Conflict begins.
	- This is the first time a Dragon has ever been killed.
