Majestic creatures, descendants of dragons, raised on the ranch.

facilitate island life, and foreign nations plan are expected to pay good money for the beasts in trade.

There are between 100 and 200 Oxdrake at [[2.Campaigns/Stonephalanx Island Campaign/Locations/Dragonroost Ranch\|Dragonroost Ranch]] at any given time. This is necessary since it is hard to raise them into adulthood. It is even harder to raise them in a way where they are healthy enough to give birth. Because they need to make sure that they have a breeding population, they need to hedge their bets. This is also part of the reason the beasts will cost a lot. Healthy Oxdrake will be a novel luxury, but they are also incredibly capable mounts in war.
