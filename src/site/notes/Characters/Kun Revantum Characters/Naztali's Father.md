# Naztali’s Father

insecure, inferiority complex, wants quick root to greatness, sees Naztali as a way to be great, gambling debt, legacy, keeps secrets, very kind, can lash out a bit when he's down, very empathetic, unkind when the chips are down, ended up indebted to the Syndicate, occasionally self-pitying at the expense of others, -----, smooth talking, sleight of hand, handyman, 

  

Worked on reconstructing a classic car as a bit of a passion project. One day it was gone, which led Naztali to ask questions. That's how she found out about his gambling debt.
