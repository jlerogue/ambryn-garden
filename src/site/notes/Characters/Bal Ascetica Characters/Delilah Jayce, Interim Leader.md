Delilah Jayce was appointed temporary leader of Auguport when the former leader, and her best friend, went on a journey to the Aspirhedge a month before the Blight. She has ruled ever since. Â  In that time, she has come to be fond of Reynere, even if she was initially told that Reynere was to be seen as a tool rather than a friend.
