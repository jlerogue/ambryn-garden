- A few teenagers who became big fans of the young Fadirson boys during a spar with [[Z.Player Characters/Cosma\|Cosma]] on the day before her maiden voyage at the [[2.Campaigns/Stonephalanx Island Campaign/Locations/Dragon's Breath Tavern\|Dragon's Breath Tavern]]. They make a couple of impromptu pieces of merch from their tank tops and ketchup. The shirts read "da Fadirson Boys"
	--(Note to self: bring these kids back later and have them boast about having seen the Fadirson Boys fight Admiral Cosma. Maybe they are selling memorabilia.)
			--Memorabilia: Piano leg that got shilleleghed, framed wall panel with claw marks, their tank tops, the rope that was used to tie the two together, and a pristine wooden chair that they handed Snorri during the fight. "He hit Cosma with it as hard as he could and she just took it with a smile. It was almost as if it was rejuvenating for her!"
