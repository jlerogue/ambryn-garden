Biggest dragon mark. On his right arm, the feathers shift slowly over to black. Nobody knows what noble house it is. He's the first person to ever have it, but Enkelt doesn't know that. Imagines he got it from his parents. This is a gift natural to him. He's not his parents. Right Hand of Darkness. Can heal undead because of tattoo. Has 15 temporary HP whenever he long rests. Can use it like lay on hands but has to hug or grapple someone. Can take damage to his regular HP instead of his temporary HP to save for later. Can't use it on unconscious people. Requires consent.

Within five feet of a person, you can surprise someone with a haymaker for an extra 2d6 damage. First round only. Renau (Maintenance guy)-  did a bunch of woodworking, helped around the orphanage, learned hurting hand when he and "Mama Ama" we're trying to make things work early on. Gave him his name. Died recently from old age. Dean Amaranth- Elvish, relative to human. “Dean” of the orphans at the Drop - gets along with, always gave good jobs, taught healing hand Gave him his name “He fell." He was placed at The Drop as an orphan when the Rising District exploded.

Copper Jones was the one who snuck Enkelt's parents into the city. Has heard stories as a result of working with Copper Jones that Karnathi people flee because of attacks on their city.

**Passcode for Copper Jones’s Stuff**

There are always two people playing cards on a metal barrel outside whenever Copper Jones is open to customers. To get in you have to do the following:

You ask them if they got room for one more.

They will say, depends. Do you know how to play?

You say, depends. You using jokers.

They will say yes. Aces wild good with you?

You say, Only if we are playing low stakes. 17 Copper is the most I can do.

They will move the barrel and open a hidden trap door in the street at this point.

Give them a copper with your initials etched into it, thank them graciously, and then proceed with haste.
