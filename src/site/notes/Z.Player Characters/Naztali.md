Prompts:

How long have you been living in the city?

_Whole life, but don’t fucking tell anybody. I gotta seem exotic._

Do you do anything you might consider criminal?

_Depends on what I stand to gain from it, and who is watching_

Your success seems pretty sudden. How does it feel for you? Especially considering that the last big songstress to work the upper rings was recently murdered.

_Feels like a long awaited affirmation of my special talents. I’m not concerned about what happened to her. I’m much smarter… and prettier._

Do you live alone? Roommates? Family?

_A lady never tells [I have a cat.]_

What is the most stressful thing about your life right now?

_Having to **perform** nearly all the time_

Do you feel safe?

_No, I’m not an idiot_

Who is your biggest fan? They seem to come to every one of your shows, no matter where you play. Mostly you work at one pretty successful venue, almost like having a residency. But whenever you get gigs elsewhere (for a sizable payment, of course), they still show up.

_Ugh, Terrance? He thinks he knows me because my music “speaks to him”. Of course it does. It speaks to everybody. Wanna know why? Cuz it’s my job, and I’m good at it._      xDe5tz

Imagine a Philippino version of me that is also 15% snake.
