My mother was Tanssi Ilonpito, a Crystal Dragonborn, and she did what she liked.

She died when I was 15 during the catastrophe.

My father is a skilled Chronomancer, Hän Pitää Ajan.

He is stoic and kind. We see each other seldomly, but have bonded more in talking about Tanssi.

My mom is an artificer - Hera Fortes.

I study the Yf.

Artificer Statistician

I love talking and being heard more than I like to listen.

I’m extremely fond of puzzles.

I don’t know when to throw something away. You never know when it might be useful again.

Invention. Make what you need out of whatever is at hand.

I repair broken things to redeem what’s broken in myself.

_You know an expert of some field who is under-appreciated and unemployed. Who are they and what is your relationship to them?_

My mom (**Hera Fortes** - human) is an artificer of some skill but has a pretty short fuse for tedious work. The death of my mother put her in a place where she realized she no longer wanted to work “for” anyone. Now she mostly focuses on odd jobs and things she really cares about creating.

_You’ve heard a rumor of a very powerful artifact hidden in the Aspirhedge. What is it, how old is it, and who has used it?_

A set of googles that could detect and view objects that looked very much like gem dragon eggs - dismissed as a fluke and discarded to wherever “failed” experiments go, Learners of Yf often refer to them as “Oculi Ruina”, the eyes of collapse. The rumor started that they were as old as the gem dragons, and were used only once before they were lost in the collapse.

_What is a holiday or tradition your family celebrated when you were young and did you maintain that tradition after the catastrophe?_

Rakan’s family practices The Nimien Vaihto, the change of names that many dragonborn practice each year to reflect on the accomplishments and failures of the year. Many practitioners maintain the event as a time to celebrate family, but more traditional practices call for an adding or changing of names to emphasize accomplishments or intent for the coming turn. Rakan has changed names a few times over his life, and still maintains the practice each year whether he is with family or alone for the holiday.

_And all the cognitions have “subdeities” in charge of portions of their domain. These deities will appear to followers, but the cognitions never do. What is one such eidolon and what is their name?_

**Idl, of Yf, Eidolon of Unspent Time**
