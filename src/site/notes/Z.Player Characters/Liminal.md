**Name Originally: Potential? Deliverance?**

**Name Now: Remainder/Scraps**

                        **-Transience**

                        **-Liminal**

**Occupation: Pirate**

**Necromancy?? Biology?? Life and death**

            **-maybe discovered that tiefling biology can survive the blight; calculations were maybe off and didnt predict the bleached skin**

**Artificers of Bal Ascetica are trying to make airships for sky piracy**

Tiefling—Saw the inside of the blight and never stopped running.

                        -tiefling vitiligo some kinda pattern

                        -black eyes gold halos

                        -dragonmark made from color left by bleaching

-Pirate; steals magic rather than goods. Always learning. Low key looking to get powerful and learned in all magics. Fantasy about “curing” the blights dichotomus with wanting to never set eyes on it ever again.

**Canto Elysium—school for magic**

**-have to pick campus/and a class**

            **-Was  blightrider came back alone; no squad**

            **-travelled in groups of 7 as a superstition**

            **-came back with only 3 of us; squad captain did not survive**

                        **-one went mad**

                        **-one was bioforged (Erin)**

                                    **-was the inaugural journey**

                                    **-maybe the bioforged was the reason we returned**

**Catastrophe 10 years ago**

            **-returned to my family/Augrport for guidance on what it was, no answers, what prompted the running?**

**Astral Belfry—was this the goal? Education with dreams of residing on the belfry??**

            **-bioforged are made here**

**When I returned to school i found a huge crater and strange trees that have shown signs of warped time all over it**

**Maybe affiliated with Jess the mess; maybe was on her father’s vessel.**

**Trying to find her dad or at least what he was looking for; failed twice already**

**What I Saw In the Blight:**

●       **Eldritch horror of some kind; something horrible. Maybe bodies of people who have perished**

●       **Maybe those who we love**

●       **Giant, grotesque**

●       **Something horrible that grabs you by your deepest fears and squeezes tight**

●       **Non Tieflings almost instantly perished. Instant chaos when we entered and it was never that way prior.**

**Relationship to Erin’s Character:**

**7 went out in the squad. Three came back. Kyle’s character, a tiefling, and Erin’s bioforged (name pending). This was the first expedition with the use of the newly created bioforged, and the bioforged might be the reason they made it back alive. The other Tiefling survivor is suffering from a madness.**

**Bioforged are created in the Astral Belfry.**

**This was nine years ago.**

**This wasn’t the first expedition into the blight, but it was the worst.**

**Stayed in Augurport.**

**The radiance of the blight caught souls in the reincarnation cycle and caused them to manifest as shades, without bodies but wanting them. People don’t believe Erin’s character about this and think it’s heretical to suggest so.**

●       **Ok so one thing Lim might do, 10 years on, is at least walk by his parents’ house/his childhood home. But he’s try to be cool about it. Being that he is “liminal” he is unable and unwilling to fully leave his “potential” behind**

●       **It’s why he still pirates mostly in knowledge of magic**

●        

●       **Ok how about this _purple one_? Would it have a small dock at all? I imagine a young Potential with a toy sword looking out over the helm of like a rowboat**

**![](file:///C:/Users/jlero/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.jpg)**

●       **Childhood home/family home. Small dock/roofed boathouse. Started Lim’s fascination with water.**

○       **Spent time playing in local parks. House was ostentatious but did not offer much of a yard**

●       **Might make more sense if they just believe something wild about it like a conspiracy. Like it’s a Fey spell and the city leaders killed the previous leader, who was a verse, and cast this spell to rule over them with fear and also keep them from visiting some holy sites to the west.**

●       **Now I’m thinking of maybe some signs they might have on their yard. Like if they have a wagon for going to the market, it might have a sign that says “Don’t be BLINDED by the BLIGHT!”, and “FEAR IS THE FORCE OF FEY CONTROL”, and “OPEN YOUR EYES”**

●       **You said your character wanted to be a captain of a ship, right?**

●       **Maybe they did manage to acquire one, took out a loan, and set sail with it only to have it captured by the black ship?**

○       **Sailed under jess the mess’s flag as a frigate in her larger fleet and she left him behind as a strategic move; Lim resents her for it.**

●       **And now you owe money and want your ship back?**
