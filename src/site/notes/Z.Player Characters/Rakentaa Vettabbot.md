### Rakentaa Vettabbot

## Mental characteristics

### Personal history

My mother was Tanssi Ilonpito, a Crystal Dragonborn, and she did what she liked.   She died when I was 10 during the catastrophe.   My father is a skilled Chronomancer.   My mom is an artificer - Hera Fortes.   I study the Yf.

### Education

Artificer Statistician

### Intellectual Characteristics

I love talking and being heard more than I like to listen. I’m extremely fond of puzzles. I don’t know when to throw something away. You never know when it might be useful again.

### Morality & Philosophy

Invention. Make what you need out of whatever is at hand.   I repair broken things to redeem what’s broken in myself.
