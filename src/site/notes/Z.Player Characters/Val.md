**Val (Valerian) LASTNAME**

**1/9/2022 Update**

Val was in a podunk port-town in Kun’Revantum when the Blight happened, and when Canto Elysium disappeared. Not paying tons of attention, it took a while for rumors to filter across the sea and make it to him. The news to trickle in over months - as rumors and jumbled reports, until he overheard a group of traveling merchants mention that the academy had “been blown to fuck-all smithereens”. A bit of digging in the rumor mill confirmed that something had happened. Feeling… some kind of way about it, Val put in notice at the bar, and shipped out with a caravan headed for Union Wharf, and from there worked his way closer to the site of the Academy, finally reaching the area around the first anniversary of the Blight. That night, as he camped alone in the shifting magical fields where Canto Elysium once stood, where he had spent 8 years of his life studying and training, the dream came for the first time.

Dream: walking the corridors of the academy, as I had so often before.

**Backstory**

Born into a moderately wealthy and influential family of humans, half-elves, and air genasi in CITYNAME, noted magical practitioners with a long and storied history. Sent at the age of 8, as was family tradition, to study in the Canto Elysium Academy, despite not showing much interest or aptitude for the magical arts. Continued to not show much aptitude for the magical arts, barely scraping by in all classes except for Basic Physical Defense (generally a 1 semester requirement, Val took it all 10 years he was at the academy), but continued to goodnaturedly and systematically try every school of wizardry, druidic arts, divine internships, even independent studies with a warlock or two, to no avail. Slow-building frustration held in check by innate assumption based on family encouragement (and repeated advice from the admissions director) that “if you keep trying hard, your individual magical path will become clear”.

It didn’t. At 18, even the continued tuition money from his increasingly exasperated family wasn’t enough to keep him enrolled. Called into the dean’s office, Val was summarily told that he seemed to have no magical aptitudes whatsoever, but that based on his transcripts they could offer him an entry-level position in campus security. Something snapped. Val came back to his senses covered in bruises, bleeding from a broken nose, tossed out the front gates by the guards after (apparently) tackling the dean, attempting to bite his ear off, tearing apart 2 priceless tomes (admissions and tuition records) and breaking 3 windows, a tables, 2 chairs, and one (1) footstool.

Dusting himself off, he set off for faroff regions including Spare Change on the other continent, some sailing, determined to get fuckall away from Canto Elysium, his family, and all things magical. 7 years passed working odd jobs in taverns, private security, caravan guarding, brawling, and generally avoiding facing any difficult decisions about what to do next. In a mighty feat of general inattention to the world at large, it took 7 years and a series of increasingly disturbing dreams for Val to learn that barely a month after his expulsion from the academy, Canto Elysium blew itself apart into a smoking crater.

Shit. That steady campus security job had just been starting to sound almost appealing. SHIT. I wonder if Karn and Luthia Prismex were still there? I think Jessek was in Hultonvault when I left, did she make it back before? FUCK. And why the fuck has Dean Multaq Dronedarone been fucking lecturing me every night for the last 2 months??

Ugh do I need to go find out what happened? I need to go find out what happened, don’t I? FUCK.

**Current Status**

After 3ish years of slowly working his way around the continent trying to track down rumors of old friends and acquaintances from Canto Elysium, Val has washed up in Union Wharf, out of money and out of leads. Trying to figure out where to go next, and earn the coin to travel there, he is staying at the Portly Puffin where he bounces part time in exchange for room and board and a small stipend. Karelio, the halfling (or gnome?) proprietor, has taken a liking to Val’s (extremely) faint resemblance to a cosmopolitan, educated, man-of-the-world, which matches his aspirations for the tavern (“we primarily serve TOWNfolk, you know, we aren’t just one of those dockside watering holes for sailors and freebooters”). That, and Val’s ability to toss drunken sailors out the door with minimal damage to the furniture (See, I HAVE learned a thing or two in the last decade), keep him employed despite being mildly unreliable.
