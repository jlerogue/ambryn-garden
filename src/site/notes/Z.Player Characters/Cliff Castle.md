●     Sanguine Root cigarettes: I buy these from an unknown supplier. They mimic the nutrients of blood and I smoke them to curb cravings before I actually have to feed.

4 previous identities:

●     **Noct d’Vitali (0-34):** The original. Born as Noct d’Vitali to the d’Vitali family who is a huge name in the city and especially in the upper ring. Captain of the Lord Mayor’s Personal Guard. Married with a newborn child and happy. A tip gone wrong about a monster trafficking ring put him face to face with a vampire who went only by the name of “Strife.” A slippery vampire who even against the Captain was able to outmaneuver him and fill Noct’s neck with vampiric venom before escaping.

○     Awoke back in the upper ring in a dark room. I could hear chains and the sound of breathing and something that smelled just so _sweet._ As I looked around I saw a terrified woman; naked and chained to the center of the room and looking in my direction as I stirred. I felt something take over inside of me that had me hungry. I soon realized what had happened remembering who I had last seen before waking up here. Caius entered the room and made a speech to me, revealing that he had orchestrated my turning. As he spoke, he tossed an object which hit the ground and rolled to my feet. It was Strife’s head whom had been disposed of after he had done what he was paid to do out of the d’Vitali’s seemingly endless coffers. After saying this to me “_Don’t get sentimental. A beast is a tool. Our role is to find the right tool for the task and to make sure they’re of the finest quality. Nature is our kingdom; never forget that we were born to rule it.”_ he slit one wrist of the woman in the center of the room to a pained whimper from her. I felt an animal inside of me tear to the front of my mind and occupy every inch of me and it was _hungry_. I reached the end of my own chain and was snapping my teeth at her answered by her with screams as she realized why her chain was so short; it was so she couldn't get away. The bolts holding my chains to the walls gave after a moment or two of pulling with the raw strength of a new vampire and I drained her without being able to control myself**_._**

●     **Dirk Grey (34-76):** After wounding Caius and escaping his grand plan for me, I was forced to give my family too little explanation before I faked my own death and disappeared within the vast city under my new name. I picked something purposefully far removed from my own name that would not draw any attention. I disappeared to the lower ring which was easy to do for anyone down there.

○     Back in those days, it was all I could do to stay fed without killing everyone I saw on the street. Sometimes I couldnt control it and would come to over the body of a man on his way home from work or a child who didn’t listen when their mother called them home to supper. I felt horribly guilty each time. I fully embraced the criminal underground of the lower ring to survive and feed my family money where I could to feel I was still taking care of them. (Realistically as d’Vitali’s, they would want for nothing) I am not proud of the time I spent as a criminal but, it did let me test the limits of where I could and could not enter, what I could do, and what I needed. Dirk was forced into an early retirement when I found myself in debt to the wrong people. I allowed myself to be kidnapped and let a local crime boss beat me senselessly and leave me in a gutter. It hurt like hell still but, I knew I would love and I knew he thought I was dead.

●     **Carmine Frost (76-109):** My first attempt at a “normal” life. After living in the criminal underground for 42 years, I figured for my third chance at life I would try to keep my head down with the straight and narrow. Not long after Dirk was dead, I had taken on my new identity and taken a job at a local market. I had a small apartment and a few friends, and really thought I had this whole normal life handled. I would visit my old family in secret though, Aldra was beginning to decline with her age which was troublesome. Living the clean life allowed me to sneak away and see her and Marcus from time to time.

○     This worked for a long time. 100 years in and I had gotten better at handling my need to feed. I would only pick the worst of the worst to feed on when I did. That crime boss got a taste of my flair for the dramatic when I stormed his hideout all by myself and drained every witness but, not before revealing to him how badly he had fucked up first, of course. I had to abandon Carmine because people were really starting to ask questions about the guy at the market they have known their whole life but has always looked the same. I slipped away quietly one night and left my apron by the register.

●     **Fox Mandrake(109-150):** My most recent identity. A slight celebrity among the rings for my underground radio show, The Night Light (in reference to moths, my primary audience) about the seedy happenings I had noticed in the city even as far back as my human days. This was the stuff that was so deep, even the criminals barely knew. We are talking secret tunnels in the city, brainwashing, propaganda, the works. This worked well for me for a very long time because nobody ever saw my face.

○     I could get the word out that these injustices were happening in the city while still being able to see Marcus. Aldra passed away a few days before her 108th birthday. I attended her service as a distant relative on her mother’s side to any who asked.

○     I met Watson when I was 150 and through him discovered that I had to get my hands back on the pulse more directly of this city if I had any chance at helping anyone. Watson reminded me of Aldra’s vision just by being himself and reminded me to help where I could and that direct action will always get more done than talking about it. I asked Watson to read a script for me that I wrote out in advance announcing that Fox had passed away peacefully in his sleep and the Night Light would be going out for now. Nobody can notice a dead guy in a crowd if he never showed his face. I started my life as Cliff Castle, Private Investigstor with Watson and have been at it for 18 years.

●     **Cliff Castle (150-Now): (More details everywhere else):** Seen the city make huge magitechnical advancements having lived 168 years. Private Investigator for the “little guy” as he tries to clean up his city one case at a time. Has a larger focus on the underbelly of the city as a whole but recognizes he is one man with Watson to help him.

**Moths:** People call people like you moths. Not vampires, but people who seem attracted to the city lights (magical) and holograms that come out at night. Just night life people. Leaning into it could be a good cover.

_The d’Vitali have been part of the city from the beginning; the d’Vitali family is numerous in members_

**Aldra d’Vitali**: My deceased wife. Mother to Marcus. Aldra was a beautiful, kind, and compassionate woman who was always willing to help those less fortunate than her. She was the most gentle person I have ever met yet fierce when she needed to protect what was hers especially when it came to her family. I emulate her to this day. I watched her and protected her the same way I did for Marcus throughout her entire life. Never remarried after I “died.” Her death was the hardest day I have ever had to live as an immortal.

**Marcus d’Vital**i: Born shortly before my time as a vampire. I have watched him throughout his entire life even though I was forced to abandon my family. I always looked out for him. I made a few bullies mysteriously “disappear” throughout his childhood. Those arent proud moments but, you don’t fuck with my son. Now 134 years old and very limited in his awareness as he nears the end of his life. I pay for his living entirely in a small apartment in the Rising District or the Lower Ring. He thinks I am a kindly neighbor who simply takes care of him from time to time and Marcus barely notices he had never seen me before he moved in here a few years back. I would still protect my boy no matter what and am currently dealing with watching the last of my original life in my son, dying before my eyes

**Violet “Sylvia” d’Vitali:** Married to Veritas. I have known her for a long time; since she was a teenager. She is a dead ringer for Aldra and it fascinated me to see her face again. I found myself visiting her more and more often to the point of obsession but never allowed myself to find anything more out about her for fear of getting too close and hurting her. This went on until I got sloppy and she noticed. She started seeking me out at night much to my chagrin and absolute shock as usually I am not the one being snuck up on. I have now grown to enjoy her visits against my better judgement. Sometimes she visits me at night and we go around the city together. She veils her face in lace and uses the name **Sylvia** as an Alias.

●     Lately, she says her husbands been acting strangely.Upper ring contact turned romantic attraction. Its mutual, mostly unspoken. We have known each other for a long time. She has begun to age, I havent in 134 years. Shes perceptive and she makes me vulnerable so, she knows my secret and I trust her to keep it. I know her real name which she told me to “make it fair” and that is how I found out she was married to my distant nephew; I already knew and let her get close anyway.

●     Last time we said goodbye, the two of us froze in the moment, time slowed down, and I become less aware of myself. My focus was on her eyes, the tension, and what you should do next. Suddenly, a cat came running past, chased by an elderly woman shouting “please, somebody help me. Buttons of getting away!” You were drawn back to reality, “Sylvia” was blushing. She laughed through a smile as she looked up at you. “Well? Y…

**Cpt. Veritas d’Vitali:** Distant nephew, descendant of Caius. Does not know about me being alive; nobody does. Does not know Violet’s relationship to me or that she has been sneaking to meet me for years. Captain of the Lord Mayor’s Personal Guard; a position I once held. Not as smart as his wife. Looks down on any ring below the Upper Ring as filthy and verminous.

**Caius d’Vitali:** Older brother; now deceased. Orchestrated my transformation. Put me on the lead of a known and slippery vampire to get me turned so that I may turn him as well. He had a view for the d’Vitali bloodline and its purity turning the curse of vampirisim into something desirable that made their bloodline strong and a pillar of the upper ring.

●     When revealing to me this vision he said this to me when I was upset he had cursed his own brother _"Don’t get sentimental. A beast is a tool. Our role is to find the right tool for the task and to make sure they’re of the finest quality. Nature is our kingdom; never forget that we were born to rule it.”_

**Watson:** Cliff’s monster sidekick. Watson is Cliff’s partner and his solution to not being able to necessarily break into places I haven't been invited to inside of. He spends the most actual facetime with Cliff so he of course knows the secret and frequently pick on Cliff for it. He “gets” Cliff in a way that its doubtful Cliff even understands. Watson cares for Cliff deeply and the feeling is unspoken but mutual or, at least Watson hopes. Cliff is not the most expressive about his emotions to Watson.

**Monte:** Minotaur who works as a bouncer but, disguises himself as a big human using magic

**Rounder:** Halfling werewolf; uses drugs like myself to suppress his curse

**Hidden Community:** Probably has a better name but, there is a whole community of folks like myself, Monte, and Rounder, who use supplementary drugs to suppress curses such as vampirism and lycanthropy

**Talia:** A halfling neighborhood child who has taken an interest in Cliff. She follows Cliff at any chance she gets despite his warning that she do not do so. Cliff tries to distance himself from her because she is pretty certain he is a vampire but has not gotten proof yet. Her childlike curiosity is a thorn in my side but I am not mean to her.

**Dusdin “Dusty” Lo’tere**: Half-orc. Local pub owner of “Dusty’s.” happened upon a rare moment of weakness where I had drained a criminal completely dry. He promised to stay silent but I owe him for his silence.

**Dog Skull:** Supplement supplier; very little known.

**DRAGONMARK**

![](file:///C:/Users/jlero/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.gif)

Yours is exceptionally large, about a foot across on your back. This is not common.

This is also a rare Dragonmark, associated with members of the d'Vitali family. It's a small human family and most of the ones that live in Sharn live on the Upper Ring.

The most prominent member of the family is Veritas d'Vitali , who is the Captain of the Lord Mayor's Personal guard. In this position, he also oversees various other law enforcing bodies in Sharn.

(The name approximately means Truth of Life. You see what I'm going for here, Mr. Vampire)

Were you a member of this family? How long ago? Were you even a Captain of the guard? What happened? Did you change your name? Stuff to think about.

Anyway, it is called The Mark of Finding. Here is what it does for you:

●     +2 wisdom, +1 constitution

●     Dark vision

●     Hunter's Intuition: when you make a perception or survival check, you can add 1d4 to the result.

●     You can speak, read, and write Goblin.

●     Once per day, you can cast Hunter's Mark

●     Once per day, you can cast Locate Object

"Don’t get sentimental. A beast is a tool. Our role is to find the right tool for the task and to make sure they’re of the finest quality. Nature is our kingdom; never forget that we were born to rule it." -Caius d'Vitalis. You can decide if this was your father, brother, grandfather, whatever.

**Family from Sharn Live in Upper Ring**

_d’Vitali is the more historical, ancient iteration of the family surname; we have been part of the city from the beginning; the Vitali family is numerous in members_

**Aldra Vitali**: My deceased wife. Mother to Marcus. Aldra was a beautiful, kind, and compassionate woman who was always willing to help those less fortunate than her. She was the most gentle person I have ever met yet fierce when she needed to protect what was hers especially when it came to her family. I emulate her to this day. I watched her and protected her the same way I did for Marcus throughout her entire life. Never remarried after I “died.” Her death was the hardest day I have ever had to live as an immortal.

**Marcus Vital**i: Born shortly before my time as a vampire. I have watched him throughout his entire life even though I was forced to abandon my family. I always looked out for him. I made a few bullies mysteriously “disappear” throughout his childhood. Those arent proud moments but, you don’t fuck with my son. Now 134 years old and very limited in his awareness as he nears the end of his life. I pay for his living entirely in a small retirement home in the upper ring. I don’t bring in near enough for that but it helps to cut the cost when your family paid for the facility to open. They think I am a distant nephew and Marcus barely notices he had never seen me before he moved in here a few years back. I would still protect my boy no matter what and am currently dealing with watching the last of my original life in my son, dying before my eyes

**Violet “Sylvia” Vitali:** Married to Veritas. I have known her for a long time; since she was a teenager. She is a dead ringer for Aldra and it fascinated me to see her face again. I found myself visiting her more and more often to the point of obsession but never allowed myself to find anything more out about her for fear of getting too close and hurting her. This went on until I got sloppy and she noticed. She started seeking me out at night much to my chagrin and absolute shock as usually I am not the one being snuck up on. I have now grown to enjoy her visits against my better judgement. Sometimes she visits you at night and you go around the city together. She veils her face in lace and uses the name **Sylvia** as an Alias. 

- Lately, she says her husbands been acting strangely.Upper ring contact turned romantic attraction. Its mutual, mostly unspoken. We have known each other for a long time. She has begun to age, I havent in 134 years. Shes perceptive and she makes me vulnerable so, she knows my secret and I trust her to keep it. I know her real name which she told me to “make it fair” and that is how I found out she was married to my distant nephew; I already knew and let her get close anyway.
- Last time you said goodbye, the two of you froze in the moment, time slowed down, and you become less aware of yourself. Your focus was on her eyes, the tension, and what you should do next. Suddenly, a cat came running past, chased by an elderly woman shouting “please, somebody help me. Buttons of getting away!” You were drawn back to reality, “Sylvia” was blushing. She laughed through a smile as she looked up at you. “Well? Y…

**Veritas (Lucian?) Vitali:** Distant nephew, descendant of Caius. Does not know about me being alive; nobody does. Does not know Violet’s relationship to me or that she has been sneaking to meet me for years. Captain of the Lord Mayor’s Personal Guard; a position I once held. Not as smart as his wife. Looks down on any ring below the Upper Ring as filthy and verminous.
