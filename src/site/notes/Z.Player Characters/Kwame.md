You know a very discerning fence. They really respect you. How did you meet? What is your relationship like?

We met when he was near death. He had been stabbed in the abdomen and I healed him free of charge. We have been maintaining a relationship by drinking together at the tavern.

Backstory… backstory… yeah

I was ostrich sized from the land of the elephant people because they were very warlike and I refused to join the army, which was required by law. So having nowhere to go I would up in the city healing people for a modest profit. I would like to earn enough money to open up a free clinic.
