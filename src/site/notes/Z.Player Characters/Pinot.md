**Answers:**

Hmmm good questions. Off the bat, definitely live alone, barren but clean apartment, never let's clients in her home

What is the living situation like? Does she live alone?

Definitely lives alone, barren but clean apartment of furniture she has found, thrifty and mismatched but decorated with a “homey” vibe. Nothing too frivolous, she puts on a fancy façade but wants her home life to be comforting and simple. She secretly likes to cook, but only shares this with Rumour. Clients do not enter her home ever; in fact, she often provides different addresses to different clients.

Is there anyone in her life important other than Rumour?

Pinot is an orphan ☹ well, as far as she knows. She has grown in this city as a product of the state since she was a small gal. She doesn’t remember her parents, but has a small locket that was placed in her pocket when she was dropped off at City Hall as a baby. ANYWAY with that being said, she trusts no one, Rumour is her only confidant, friend, support system ect.

What’s her most important childhood memory?

A memory of some of the older orphans beating up an orderly because he was abusing a handicapped orphan. This resonates with her due to the display of power shift/ standing up for those who can’t do so for themselves.

Is she living how she wants?

Yes, it’s really the only thing she knows, and she resents the upper circle. She uses the rich to make money for herself, but mostly because she enjoys taking from them. She enjoys her modest life.

What’s the most stressful thing going on in her life right now?

Some of the gals/ guys at work haven’t been showing up for their shifts, complaints of “odd behavior”. No one can really provide a solid explanation, other than, “I was just so tired”.

What does she do for fun?

Cooking! Baking! Overall cheffery!

Sex work is legal, but does she do anything illegal?

NAH and she takes pride in that. Rumour does club drugs though, and she often takes care of him when he stumbles in fucked up, which she doesn’t mind at all.

Favorite bar?

This question is the hardest because I NEED TO COME UP WITH A WITTY NAME.

Edit: Pins & Pipes (classy underground lounge with pretty ladies who sing, the scene in my head is THE ROADHOUSE Twin Peaks) Anyway, I like this bar because I can *pretend* to blend in but really I’m just people watching and gathering intel.

Not currently. Maybe in the past, but still gotta ponder on that one.

Fears?

Getting close to others, forming relationships ect. She is caring of the gals/ guys at work, in a motherly way, but refuses to accept love from them.

Most important ideal?

FUCK THE RICH
