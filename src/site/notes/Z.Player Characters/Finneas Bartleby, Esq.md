Finneas Bartleby, Esq.

-       This guy is a sleazy defense attorney.

-       He will take any type of client no matter how rich or poor, guilty or innocent.

-       Since he has such a vast network of criminal defendant clients, he often needs to broker deals between clients to come to a reasonable resolution and keep one or the other off the books or at least out of jail.

-       He can make a crime disappear.

-       A guy who can get you things.

Does your character feel lonely?

Finneas doesn’t have time to feel lonely! If he did, he would.  He has all the trappings of a rich life; powerful friends, a hot wife (Marie Bartleby), a great job, living in the upper ring.  Behind closed doors he’s overworked, overstressed, always nervous that his (arguably moral) questionable acts will catch up with him or his family, and very much alone.  He takes care of the household his wife is too sick to care for, he gets the worst clients through the firm (he’s the newest lawyer), and, just a guy with impostor syndrome from the lower rings, he doesn’t feel “in” with the upper ring crowd he should now belong to. 

Do they have friends?

He has some friends, mostly his crowd consists of colleagues. His few real friends are not powerful people, but he spends most of his time with powerful people. His closest friends are an assistant who used to work for him until the assistant got too caught up in the organized crime syndicate that hired Mr. Bartleby’s office and a girl he grew up with in the lower ring who works at a tea shop a ways away from Mr. Bartleby’s home (he visits frequently anyway).   

Do they live with any family?

He lives with his wife. 

What is their love life like?

He’s married, but his wife is sort of barely there.  She doesn’t usually leave the house.  Nobody’s sure exactly what’s wrong with her.  She’s just like, one of those ladies who is always “feeling faint.”  He loves her very much.  When she can get out of bed, he loves spending time with her.  Most of the time she can’t, though, and lonely Finneas whose friends are far away calls on escorts for company to dinner with his colleagues.  He doesn’t usually sleep with them but he can sometimes get some perspective on his clients’ cases by chatting with them over drinks after those business dinners.  Obviously he has a huge crush on the tea girl.

What is the most stressful thing they got going on in their life right now?

He’s constantly saddled with anxiety about maintaining his position in the upper ring.  He feels over his head as an associate who is very concerned with making sure the firm keeps bringing in money and takes any case he can in order to make sure that happens.  In addition, he faces a lot of political pressure from both the higher-ups and the lower-downs to make sure their records are squeaky clean.  He’s no stranger to a tense, potentially dangerous situation.  He’s not particularly good at talking his way out of those things, but it’s the only weapon he really has.  He IS pretty good at making everyone happy.  Anyway he has a case right now where he’s trying to defend a political leader who expects to be accused of some nefarious deed.  He’s trying to talk to the prosecutor to convince her not to indict the guy, trying to broker a circular deal for some little guy to take the fall and then be pardoned by the leader before trial, trying to manage the guy’s image in the media, and facing pressure from the guy to make sure it all works out.

He has similar types of problems with clients from the underworld, except the image management aspect here is a bit different. 

People they want to protect?

His clients, his friends, and his wife.

Someone they’re trying to keep kind of close even though they don’t have a good relationship because they know this person could help them later?

Finneas has a LOT of people like this.  There’s a gross judge that Finneas got out of trouble a few years back who might be able to do him some favors or give him some information in the future about cases he’s defending for his clients.  The judge could just as easily make a promise and betray Finneas.  The judge is very gross and bad he would have done something Epstein-y or maybe like colluded with some evil politicians to divert waste or stuff that’s bad for people to the lower rings, maybe that’s why Finneas’ wife is Mysteriously Ill.
