Constructed when the Dragonwar was being fought atop coastal cliffs overlooking the rocky shores and jutting stones that helped give [[Locations/Regions/Banzi Hilands/Stonephalanx Islands\|Stonephalanx Islands]] its name. Back when they fought alongside dragons, this was used as a ranged fortification for supporting dragons.

About a day's travel from [[Locations/Regions/Banzi Hilands/Oldport\|Oldport]] and [[2.Campaigns/Stonephalanx Island Campaign/Locations/Castle Silverveil\|Castle Silverveil]] .
