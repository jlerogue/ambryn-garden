# God Gavel Arch

The God Gavel Arch names two things. First, it is the name for a series of six islands Northeast of the Tritonlocke Torrent. They resemble a horseshoe when looked at from above.

The southern most island is home to a stone arch called the God Gavel Arch. This azure colored monument is inscribed with runes and was supposedly carved and constructed by the clergies of four separate gods in a prehistorical era. Its exact age is not known, but its function is largely agreed upon. The purpose of the arch is to test the fidelity of love between partners who pass through it. If there is any doubt in one of their hearts, or intentions to deceive, or ulterior motives, then one of the partners will disappear leaving the other alone. Which partner disappears is not known, but people tend to assume that the “pure” partner is the one who remains. Some believe the arch merely demonstrates worthiness in the eyes of the gods. Much of this is speculation.

It has served as a tool to test potential marriages between people from different cultures in cases where one or both partners is a member of a high church, the monarchy, or some form of leadership in a community. The last time it was used in this official capacity was in the year 177 NE on the 5th of Ymwake, nearly 300 years ago. On this day, the monarchy of Bryn Chalice ended. Since then, an elected senate and the church govern the city.

That day was meant to be the wedding of Prince Varnas of Bryn Chalice and a Yuan Ti woman named Alma. They held hands and walked through the arch confidently. When they arrived at the other side, they embraced one another. They were about to kiss when an arrow pierced Varnas’ throat. Within seconds, arrows rained down on the dozens in attendance, leaving no survivors. Then who told the tale? Nobody. Instead, a Yuan Ti from Revantum Nova, working as a head researcher and secretly possessing the gift of sight wielded by the Reprisal and the Four Verses, saw the truth of the moment in a dream. Two hundred years had passed since the day of the ceremony.

A tomb was constructed within a month of the Prince’s death. It is, fittingly enough, called the Tomb of Varnas, although Alma was also laid to rest there. Tritons guard this tomb, and have for centuries.

Overall, the climate on these islands is tropical, and, aside from its morbid history, peaceful.

Sometimes Triton diplomats agree to meet trusted outsiders here.

Mostly, however, the island serves as a meeting place for rum runners and merchants. Occasionally, naval ships from Revantum Nova visit the island following rumors that Bal Ascetican pirates use the islands known as the God Gavel Arch as a safe haven but they never find anyone or anything that could serve as evidence. Perhaps there are clandestine hideouts here?

It is also rumored that The God Gavel Arch is home to an entrance to The Emerald Exchange, a shop of wonders run by a Fairy Patron named Madam Emerald, who extends invites to individuals who have performed great acts of heroism. This invitation allows a person to see and open the portal to the pocket plane where The Emerald Exchange exists. There are a series of these portals around the world. Madam Emerald refuses to allow visitors to use these portals for traveling, though, so visitors must leave from the door they used to arrive. This can be a bit of a labor, as the hallway of doors to countless locations is quite long. It is unknown what would happen if someone were bold enough to exit through a door without permission. It is also unknown if any of this is true. It could just be a rumor. Many things you hear at sea or in taverns are works of fiction, but good pirates know that there is often an element of truth to be found, even as a tale morphs from retelling to retelling.

## Function
Some wedding ceremonies occur at the Godgavel Arch, where couples, before they are wed, hold hands and cross under the stone monument. It is believed that, if there is insincerity in their heart, or an Eidolon disagrees with the union, then one half of the couple disappears into oblivion.  
  
Some marriages of political significance occur here in order to bring peace of mind to the families, and settlements, involved.  

The exact nature of the arch is a matter of speculation, but it is demonstrably true that not all who walk beneath it as part of a ceremony make it through to the other side.
