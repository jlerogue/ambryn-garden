The oldest tavern currently operating in Augurport. Used to be owned by a man who owned the nearby vineyard, but the vineyard is now owned by the city and the tavern itself has also switched hands. Â  The game of **Diviner's Dice** is said to have been invented here. A Crystal Ball is set at each table to facilitate the game.
