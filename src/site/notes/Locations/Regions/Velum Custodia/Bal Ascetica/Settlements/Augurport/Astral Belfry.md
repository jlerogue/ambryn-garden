The Astral Belfry is a three-towered cathedral located on a floating mote of earth above the Amber Willow of the Omen Arboretum outside of Augurport.   The belfry is run by a diverse group of monks representing interests and factions from all over the Bal Ascetica region. A good majority of these monks come from the Scatterscale Steppe, where they speak on behalf of the Dragons living behind the three Dragongates. They also oversee the care of dragon eggs found orphaned around the world within the Belfry's subterranean halls.   The monks of the Astral Belfry study a variety of magic, their research governed by the leaders in Augurport who speak on behalf of the stars. It was the monks of the Belfry that first discovered how to bind a soul stuck between life and rebirth to a construct called a Warforged.

Because of its safety, and ability to move across Bal Ascetica when necessary, the Astral Belfry serves as the gathering location for the Council of Eight, which is a group comprised of officials from the eight settlements of the Bal Ascetican alliance.
