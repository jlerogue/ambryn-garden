Hulltonvault is a large city defined by secrets. Most of its population, both foreign and native, exist in its outer district. To move into the inner walls means to swear a life of secrecy and service in which most of the pledged citizens rarely see outside the city walls again. To reward these citizens for their duty, a vast supply of resources are utilized to ensure that people living in the inner district have access to nearly limitless luxuries and pleasures. Â  The city has earned its right to secrecy in the eyes of the other city states across Bal Ascetica. It has always used its powers to protect the various settlements from most forms of disaster, be it a tactfully deployed barrier to stop an impending meteor strike toward Augurport (which had forseen the event and cleared out most of its citizens by that point), or a conjured flame to terminate a ceaseless army of undead presumed to be members of a Karnathi legion. Hulltonvault refuses to involve itself in any strife that may arise between the Bal Ascetican city states, although they do have a court in place precisely for matters in which they must, should the day ever come. The court's primary duties are measuring blame and rendering judgement if conflict gets out of hand.  
The secrecy has rarely led to issue for the people of the city. Currently, members of the outer district are starting to entertain rumors that the most recent Sorcerer King is dead, and has been for quite some time.

### Demographics

Humans, Changelings, Kobolds, Orc, Kalashtar, Drow, and Grung.

### Government

The members of the government, and its multiple branches, are another facet of the city's secrets. The belief that secrecy facilitates safety and unrestrained adherence to duty are central to this design.

### Defences

The city utilizes various wards, and a store of ancient weapons and magical knowledge, to keep itself safe without need to risk a single life. A group of trained templars, called the Templars of the Veil, do travel the world on behalf of the city to research, investigate, and stop any potential threats of an arcane nature. Some city states take issue to this practice and consider it an unchecked overreach.

### Guilds and Factions

Templar of the Veil.

### History

The city was founded atop a vault of ancient weapons and a crypt of primordial giants. The families that settled there to guard these items grew. As new people came across the vault, the families invited them to partake in the duty of guarding the vault. Those who refused had their minds temporarily altered and were sent on their way.  
Hulltonvault has declined invites to become part of the Bal Ascetican alliance.
