Union Wharf. Some look at it and see beauty. After all, it borders the open sea. Others look at it and see isolation. It can be hard to reach, what with the alpine slopes and the hostile swamps.  
The town was founded a decade ago in 465 NE by Domino Finch and Dread Jed Walker after the catastrophe brought what was once a town of tall towers and world famous stone masonry to rubble. It is the town furthest from the Blight, and closest to the outside world as it possesses the most accessible port to the entire Bal Ascetica region. Or at least it would, were it not for the town’s celebration of piracy and the open seas.  
It’s a town built from fossilized wood atop ancient stone. It’s a town of fortunate folk and cursed folk alike, with no room for middling luck between them. But even the cursed folk live well enough, as the fortunate ones always make sure to share in their serendipity.  

But as happy as the people here may be, trouble brews. Food is easy to come by, but other resources remain scarce. Dread Jed Walker led plenty of expeditions when he was still around, but “imports” from Revantum Nova, and magical items more legitimately acquired, are becoming more and more scarce since his disappearance.  
His daughter, Jess "the Mess” Walker, doesn’t know if she can ever stand in his stead, but she does believe that she can track him down if she can only figure out what treasure he was seeking on his final voyage.
