Augurport is the capital of Bal Ascetica although its culture is no longer representative of the region at large as many settlements had to change their practices after their catastrophe. Trauma, and an overall change in behavior, can be seen in many areas, although a reverence for magic and the eidolons remains. Augurport, however, is full of faithful who take comfort in their knowledge of divination: it is not rare for folk from Augurport to consult dice, cards, or the church in matters big and small.   Presentation is important to them, and a massive floating crystal in the center of the town, called a cleansing stone, purifies the air and generally evaporates debris. For the most part, Augurport looks like a city unaffected by ruin. From the outside, one might think Augurport is flourishing. Large, animated constructs of wood and stone harvest wheat from massive farms and pick a variety of brilliantly colored fruits from the orchards surrounding the Omen Arboretum, holy site of an ancient, partially fossilized tree called the Amber Willow. Above its branches, which stretch out a hundred yards providing rare shade for the region, is a floating land mass shaped like an open palm. This is where the [Astral Belfry](/w/ambr-yn-jacklerogue89/a/astral-belfry-location) can be found, and it is where the Council of Eight conduct meetings behind closed doors where they discuss the interests of the region.   Its citizens would disagree. Their main patrons, the Eidolons Rondo and Anima, are gods that commune through celestial bodies. Unfortunately, Auguport is the settlement closest to the Blight, a massive wall of light that is toxic to most people. It seems to stretch up to the heavens themselves, and it casts its light across the city and beyond, day and night, concealing the night sky entirely. This area is called the [[Locations/Unused or Unsorted Locations/Neverdusk Range\|Neverdusk Range]]. It’s more than an annoyance to the folk of Augurport, but it’s not dangerous. Outside of the city’s emerald walls, flush to the western most wall, is where peril begins. Stepping into the blightlands is certain, and immediate death, with rare exception. Gem Dragons seem immune, and a legion of them have taken to procuring resources from the Blightlands. The [[1.Ambryn/Culture/Factions/Blightriders\|Blightriders]] are also the only creatures able to cross through the Blightlands to other regions, meaning the entire Bal Ascetica is effectively unreachable by land.   Tieflings can survive, too, although the long-term effects of exposure aren’t certain. A couple hours in the Blight, though, and their skin turns snow white, and their eyes begin to resemble golden halos. If other people can cross through, well, they haven’t dared try. Very recently, the Blightriders came back with half of their patrol missing. Seven gone, and mourned, but why? Some of them say they saw something in the light. One of them described it as an aura of voices given form, but that was all he could say coherently before he was taken by madness. He is currently being studied in the Astral Belfry, his family praying for the day the [[Lunar Gown\|Lunar Gown]] reveals the [[Temple of the Sullen Moon\|Temple of the Sullen Moon]] once more.  

#### Prevalent Beliefs

- **The Law of Contagion:** A metaphysical belief positing that all souls are bound together in some way when they cross paths and this relationship can only be undone through rituals.  
- **The border between planes must be guarded at all costs:** The biggest threats to Ambr’yn will come from other planes. Some believe that salvation can come from other planes, as external variables are the only thing that can change the course of fate, which could bring ruin in the next century. Even in Augurport, and among this small group of believers, the notion of fate is contested in this situation. But the end result is the same, as both parts of this group believe the end is night. Some just believe sentient beings can’t correct their behavior.  
- **Prepare for Doomsday:** Some are making efforts to live underground to avoid the [[Creeping Blight\|Creeping Blight]] (assuming it’s real).

### Demographics

Most residents are Elves, Kalashtar, Yuan-ti, or a rabbitfolk called Harengon who have been exiled from their homelands in Aspirhedge by a court of Fey creatures.

### Defences

A small force of mages called the Amber Guard. They use illusion magic to create mirror images of themselves. Every individual unit has a mage or two that can readily provide a cloak of invisibility or a temporary retreat into the Etherial Border for their allies. Leaders and tacticians generally take to the sky atop broomsticks to get a full view of battle and then relay messages to squadron leaders on the ground. Since war hasn’t been a threat since the catastrophe, the military is partially retired. Some troops patrol the nearby lands, while others operate as guards in the town, although their duties rarely amount to more than helping elder citizens put up shelves, rescuing cat familiars from trees, and getting drunks home safely.

### Industry & Trade

• High quality vegan cheese.  
• Famous bakeries.  
• Very colorful and expensive fashion.  
• Wine.  
• Massive library.  
• An excessive use of magic to the point where citizens commonly use magic to accomplish mundane tasks. Bootstraps undone? Tie it with mage hand.  

### Guilds and Factions

Blightriders, Gathering Guild.

### History

Founded by people who shaped the sky. Designed the constellations. That tradition continues but a new constellation hasn’t been created in three centuries.   Augurport claims to have bound the first soul to a construct to create the original Warforged, which is a claim contested by Revantum Nova. Augurport recently created Warforged that are organic, aside from their inorganic skeletal structure, that can eat, reproduce, and eventually die a natural death.
