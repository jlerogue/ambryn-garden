Scatterscale Steppe is the home of two nomadic peoples, previously unified as the Scatterscale People, who have separated due to a cultural rift that is increasingly more difficult to work out with each passing day. Now they honor their ancient, shared duties of guarding one of the three **Dragon Gates** separately.   The Imminent Ones, the newer group, is run by a Lizardfolk named Tusk. Tusk, a Mage Emeritus from [Canto Elysium](/w/ambr-yn-jacklerogue89/a/canto-elysium-article) Academy, had gone away for the better part of a decade, only to return far older due to his studies in the time-bending library at the center of the college. His brother, Marrow, is the current leader of the Scatterscale People. He welcomed Tusk back with pride, and even though the two would disagree regularly about tradition and progress, they maintained a brotherly love.   Then their leader was slain by an outsider. This was 18 years before the catastrophe.   An extravagant festival was held in his honor. That night, dozens of members from the Scatterscale People participated in a tournament. Some were only interested in the show of it — the honor it. But everybody knew that the winner would be the next leader. It was, after all, tradition.   By all accounts, Marrow had Tusk on the ropes. Tusk wasn’t insufficient with the blade, but Marrow had always been superior.   In a desperate move, Tusk bound Marrow with magic, immediately incapacitating him. The rules weren’t clear on whether this was allowed. Thus began the debate. People in [Augurport](/w/ambr-yn-jacklerogue89/a/augurport-settlement) who have caught wind of the tale tell it in an almost derisive way. “Why can’t they simply incorporate magic into their traditions?” Tusk tried to be gentler with Marrow, insisting that the Scatterscale Folk move into a new era and use magic beyond the limited knowledge bestowed upon them by dragons. Tusk’s followers, though he never meant to accrue them, weren’t as patient and, before long, separation was the only way to avoid violence.   Then the catastrophe happened. Now strange blue crystals that react to magic have sprung up. The Imminent Ones, while experimenting with enchantment spells, accidentally caused a volatile reaction in one. There was a mighty explosion, and Marrow’s followers experienced most of the fallout from that. The mage tribe was forced to distance themselves even further.   Things grew even worse for Marrow’s people. They have found themselves needing to fend off unsanctioned mining operations from an anonymous group as well as an increase in beast activity as monsters seem drawn to the area. They want answers but can’t find them. The Imminent Ones want to help but are not allowed to intervene.

### Geography

Scatterscale Steppe decreases in size daily. Its grasslands now overlap with an area called Blue Scar Crest, which was the epicenter of strange, explosive magic the day of the catastrophe. The Crest has been designated an area of concern so folks from Augurport have banned people from walking throughout the fields of massive blue crystal without an authority from Augurport to guide them. The crystal growths seem to be spreading outward, though, forcing the two groups to live closer and closer together.

**Population**: 1,500, most of which are Lizardfolk, Tortle, and Humans.
