Its people are called Karnathi.

Things they produce are called "Karnathi -noun-". For example, "Karnathi Wool."

Some souls in Karn persist after death, sustained by dedication to their loved ones. These are called **Testaments**

Other souls live on sustained by hate or sorrow.

The former is a result of regularly practiced magic in Karn.

The latter is a result of a long banished, rarely practiced magic, mastered by the first Lich to ever rise in the region. **Note: Scrtch'm Scrotch'm, who attacked Cliff Castle, was one of these. It isn't necessarily true that Scrtch'm Scrotch'm was from Karn**

That lich disappeared when Karn produced another lich named A'rak. The reason for the disappearance is unknown.

An archlich was trained in secret to oust A'rak. They battled under a Karnathi temple where A'rak secretly kept a phylactery.
