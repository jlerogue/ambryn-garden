People started moving out toward the location that would come to be known as Fortune's Hollow 40 years ago when news broke that there were valuable minerals in the mountains there. Rumors of an ancient and powerful magical forge also began to circulate.

The first settlers were people from the economically deprived Lower Ring of Revantum nova, but a noble house of Revantum Nova soon bought up most of the locally available materials that were used to produce the tools necessary to mine the incredibly hard minerals around Fortune's Hollow. They also took out a patent on the crafting techniques and alchemical practices used to produce various mining materials.

It is practically a ghost town these days.
