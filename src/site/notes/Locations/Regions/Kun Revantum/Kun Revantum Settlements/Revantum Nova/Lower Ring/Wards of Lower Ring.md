- The First is the oldest district, and where Nova Revantum started, before there were rings or even districts. 500 years old, and mostly forgotten, a symbol of the ideals and promises that the city was founded on. Lost to the past. 
    

- Dockside, the warehouse and fishing ward. Has a ton of inns. Immediate access to a tower to the middle ring so gold carrying travelers can easily get to the middle ring. Second Strongest presence of the Private Guard, unless you count Off-duty members. 
    

- Station Ward. Strongest presence. Has a rail heading north that splits off in two directions, one of which previously went to Karn. That is now decommissioned. The station is where you might find soldiers returning from battle, miners, and refugees. Military base in this ward, too. As such, some brothels and inns have found good business here. Lots of recruitment done for base around lower ring. Lots of fliers trying to drum up support for the war effort. Discarded or dispelled recruits make for good Private Watch hires. 
    

- Inside Pillar, a district near central pillar gate. A market district. Residences are primarily inhabited by small business owners, and they all pay rent to a single person who is a big shot of just the one district 
    

- Outer Pillar, a very crowded residential district. Leaving and exiting involves going through gates, no direct access to leaving Revantum Nova. Most illusory magic and decoration has faded and the little that is upkept is either graffiti or a bleak reminder of how they are really seen. 
    

- Garden District. City Gates. Creates a good first impression, has some upscale shops, tourism center, and access to sky carriages and central pillar lift. Pickpockets looking to take advantage of tourists can try their luck here but the punishment for being caught is steep. Imprisonment, military service, or worse. 
    

- Rising district, where slightly less poor people live. They feel superior to Outer Pillar folk and don’t think it is fitting to bite the hand that feeds. Some of them have children that would disagree. One punk character spends time in Outer Pillars, and her friends call her Noble, jokingly. Her name is Grace, but they call her Your Grace and Slumlady, because her parents own parts of the Pillars. (Her dad isn’t quite corrupt, but is unprincipled. He is being pressured to do some nefarious things, though, Might be interesting to investigate.)
