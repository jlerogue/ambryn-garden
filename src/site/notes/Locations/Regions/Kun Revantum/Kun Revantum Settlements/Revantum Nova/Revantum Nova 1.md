From Revantum Nova Enchiridion: A Visitor's Guide to the City of Towers   _Our great city celebrates its 200th year since its founding this year, and I would imagine that you know all there is to know about it. Feel free to disregard this! But our city has a long history as a premier tourist destination. If you've just now found yourself taking your first life-changing steps within our city walls, then this article is for you._   _Revantum Nova rests against the shimmering majesty of the Amorant Confluence, where_ _the Malico and Kompatica rivers join one another on a trip to the Far Sea, which is a_ _bit of a misnomer. As the City furthest West on the Kun’Revantum continent. So for_ _us, it’s more like the Close Sea! By foot, it’s a mere day of travel away. If you_ _prefer to travel by airship, you can be there in an hour! And best yet, a trip aboard_ _a Westward-Bound Lightning Rail will have you there in ten minutes, tops!_   _Revantum Nova, as you know, is a tiered city, where each of the three main tiers are_ _held up by a beautiful series of columns wrapped in vines with tall buildings providing_ _just a little bit of extra structural support. The streets are paved in concrete or_ _cobblestone, depending on where you go, although future improvements are planned_ _in which some areas would be paved in rare metals to fully demonstrate our thriving_ _economy to visitors. But first we want to make sure everybody’s needs are taken care_ _of! And before that, we have to make sure our military efforts are well funded. It is a_ _time of war, after all, and who knows what the other nations are up to. A_ _Karnnathan army of undead could show up at our gates and in such situations, it’s_ _best to be prepared. Especially against those who pervert death, and donate their_ _bodies to their nation in the name of “honor.” Did you know they have a large statue_ _of an arch lich in their town? And those whose bodies aren’t used in battle are_ _cremated and injected into the stone? It’s awful! Simply awful! But I digress._   _It takes about half an hour to walk from one end of a plate to another, although it’s_ _possible to travel quickly with ease thanks to the help of sky taxis – elemental_ _powered sleds that can move in every direction. In terms of transportation, we also_ _have out lightning rail which , as you know, departs in every compass direction.

##### Locales  


_

_Revantum Nova’s population of nearly half a million citizens are divided up across five main districts, which span the city’s three plates. These districts, of course, have their own neighborhoods within them, but most of them can be painted in broad strokes. So let’s do just that, shall we?_    

_**Upper Plate**:_

  
_• Where the crème de la crème live._  
_• Here you can see the floating mansions of_ _**Skyway**, sprawling museums, and the personal airships of some of_ _our most prestigious families._  
_• **The High Towers**, the seat of city government, is located here_.  

_**Central Plate**:_

  
_• If you want to see beautiful temples, dazzling shows, and the childhood homes of famous artists, the_ _Central Plate is the place to go._  
_• **The Revantum Watch**, who guard the Central and Upper Plate are all given residence here._  

_**Lower Plate**:_

  
_• The_ _**dock ward** is a hub of activity. There’s **a market** and many find different kinds of work on the_ _different kinds of ships here._  
_• Guarded by a mercenary group called **“The Open Eyes,”** instead of the Revantum Watch. Dutiful citizens_.

    ##### Revantum Nova -- Lower Ring
    
    The Lower Ring of Revantum Nova is where the city's fabled history began nearly two centuries ago in an area now called The First. From there, it expanded to include a campus where over half of the settlers took part in arcane studies.   Mordion University as an institution no longer exists but its spirit lives on in various successors on the Upper Rings. And the old building is still a marvel of architecture. Soldiers were recently deployed by the City to patrol the area in a preservation effort. Their duties include chasing off kids and nothing else.   This is how the Tourism Department would spin it, although they might not mention the hooliganism. What people on the Lower Ring know is that it's a crummy place to live, even if the residents themselves aren't half bad. There is fun to be had in some of the bars, and places like House Allure in the Inner Pillar district offer a much-needed respite for the weary souls from The Stacks in the Outer Pillar. Even soldiers from Station Ward sometimes make their way over, although similar businesses can be found near the decommissioned Lightning Rail because everybody knows frustrated troops can make for good business, so long as you have tough-as-nails bouncer to keep them in line when they get rowdy.   Few people on the Lower Ring burden themselves with the hope of moving to the Middle Ring. The exception to this rule is found in the Rising District, where landlords and the slightly less fortunate reside in a series of towering apartment complexes. These fairly new structures were built on the scorched remains of the Sixth Ward where immigrants and refugees previously resided until the tragedy struck in the form of an underground explosion. The catastrophe is still being investigated, but a prevalent belief casts blame on unnamed Karnathi terrorists.
