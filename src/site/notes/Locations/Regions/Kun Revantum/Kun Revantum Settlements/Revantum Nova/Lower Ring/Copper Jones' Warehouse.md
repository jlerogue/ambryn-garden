Here’s how to get in if it comes up: 

There are always two people playing cards on a metal barrel outside whenever Copper Jones is open to customers. To get in you have to do the following: 

You ask them if they got room for one more. 

They will say, depends. Do you know how to play? 

You say, depends. You using jokers? 

They will say yes. Aces wild good with you? 

You say, Only if we are playing low stakes. A Copper is the most I can do. 

They will move the barrel and open a hidden trap door in the street at this point. 

Give them a copper with your initials etched into it, thank them graciously, and then proceed with haste. 

Exterior: 

They go into the entrance and walk down some stairs. Now they’re in the real undercity. Chasms and caves, part natural, part made by druids and elbow grease. A large wooden warehouse at the base of the stairs. Otherwise, just a totally closed off cave, except for a long, claustrophobic crevice that makes its way out to the (look up the name of The Confluence.)  

Sometimes Copper Jones smuggles people in through the city this way. Inside, lanterns with continual flame spells hang from rafters. Steepled roof. Crates and crates of stuff. A goblin in glasses with a magnifying glass stands at a counter inspecting a book. Copper Jones pays him in books. The counter is otherwise covered with weapons and technology, of a wide range of quality. Some new. Some old. The Goblin’s name is Trilby. He wears a navy blue suit and has his atypically blonde hair swept neatly to the side. 

A red carpeted area is two the right of the entrance. Two long bookshelves, about 10 feet long, line the east and southern wall, coming together to meet in the corner. There, in a red  leather chair, feet up on an ottoman, sits a hulking figure. It’s face is covered by a newspaper. He casually sits there reading, seemingly unaware of your presence. 

When they address him, he’ll hold up a finger. Look over the top of the paper, then put it down. Rise from his chair slowly. Look at Cliff. Then at Kwame. Smiles. “Friends. I didn’t know you two were acquainted, and I know damn near everything. And I imagine that’s why you’re here. Can I fix any of you a drink?” 

He grabs his bookshelf and effortlessly slides it to the side. It’s not on rails or wheels. He’s just massive. Behind it is an alcove filled with liquor and glasses.
