**Interior**

Then describe the gates. massive gates (a railway and station are here, and two large open gates in the city wall. The rail extends out west across the ocean. Through it, you see the sullen moon hang full above the water. It’s pallid reflection is the only other thing you see in the abyss. Its glow leans in through the massive gates, painting light across a sign that reads “Binder Punk’s Railside Lounge.” The sign hangs above the doorway of an old repurposed dining car. This car has been welded together with a shipping crate to form a cozy lounge that can comfortably accommodate a couple dozen people.
Warforged mill about the area, carrying large beams of steel in from the Dockward to a factory near the military barracks. Atop a strip club, you see two guards. One is a goliath, the other a skinny human, but they are mostly cast in shadow and it’s hard to make out their details. You can tell that they are drunk by the way they slur their words when they start catcalling:
‘Ey, pale skinny boy? Your legs tired? Because I’ve got a place for you to sit right here,” says the Goliath, gesturing to his face. 

**Exterior:**
Multiple people in the lounge. Musicians perform, the smell of tobacco mixes with the smell of perfume, and lanterns illuminated by arcane crystals pulse with a purple light. 

A male human is performing in the corner, though there is no stage. He wears a blue suit and is accompanied by no music. He’s captivating and seems to have the practiced ability to trick people into thinking she’s making eye contact with them as she gazes over the crowd.
The place is crowded with all sorts of people. Warforged sailors have a table to themselves, and they seem more interested in one another’s company than the show. They’re loud, drunk, and a bit rowdy. A small purple-haired gnome shushes them and despite the difference in size and number, the immediately shut up. The gnome turns his attention back to the singer.
