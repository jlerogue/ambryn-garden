**Located in the side of a Mesa in the Western Steppe. Various experiments have been carried out here.**

**S.H.I.F.T.E.R Project was the most recent.**

**Four Side Rooms, a secret basement (bookshell entrance, puzzle, or falling through weak floor). Partially in disrepair. Ceiling pieces can fall on them.**

**A shelf that used to store vials is totally gone, but they can look around and find one. It glows green, and has multi colored strands.**


A metal door that reacts to Cliff's Dragonmark. It opens to what appears to be a mansion built into the Mesa. You stand in a grand foyer that has two doors off to the east and two off to the west. There is nothing on the far wall, nor is there the typical master carpted staircase you'd expect from a locale like this. In the middle of the room, you see an iron staircase, spiraling up through a hole in the ceiling, presumably to a second floor. Green light pulses from under some of the door ways, and you can see scratch marks on the inside of the metal doorway you just entered from.
Insight: If these creatures were outside, it might mean that a d'Vitali, or someone else who was permitted entrance, was recently here. You're not sure, yet, which dragonmarks have authorization. Or if there's another way in or out.
Things they'll encounter:

A violent repetitive rattle>snap sound resonates through the manor that indicates a chained creature is trying to get free.

(I'll ask Cliff if, perhaps, he has a feeling that he's been here before. When he gets to the basement, especially, he'll remember his final moments with his brother)

Magic Items. Arrows. A version of Oathkeeper that will break on a one or a two. Made from Arbor Vitalis. Stained black on the front, still red on the back. Silver string, so you'd have to change it out. Cracked in some places. Might need to find a way to repair it.

Schematic for Soulmonger. It is affixed to the top of the city.
	A journal entry contains the following bits of information.
		The author, Dr. Yahulz, a gnome, hopes that upcoming Plate Mayor of the Upper Ring will be pleased. Caius certainly seems happy with the progress so far.
	The experiments have been heavily informed by "restricted" books that were stolen from Karn.
	They've also been informed by works in the old abandoned Mordion Academy in the University District of the Lower Ring.
	"How do I obtain a creature like this? Can I engineer it? Can I summon it? Perhaps I could do it if I had the other half of that cursed tablet."
	**Last page says S.H.I.F.T.E.R Project. Underlined but nothing more is said.**


Basement:
Caius' daughter, who held the position of Cloud Captain after him, is in there, suspended in a tube, needles in her arms, chains around her body. 

Her name is Celestine d'Vitali. Looks a bit like Carmilla.

Originally thought to have been assassinated at a much older age (Caius did the assassination).

Her son (and technically the son of Caius, but also the grandson of Caius?) replaced her. 

That was Veritas, and Veritas seemed like a noble boy who had aspirations of being a hero and changing the way the guard force was perceived. 

He was also curious about the explosion in the rising district.

Why does it look like Carmilla?
--Reincarnation?
--Clone?
--Genetic experiment?
--An ancestor?
--Coincidence?
