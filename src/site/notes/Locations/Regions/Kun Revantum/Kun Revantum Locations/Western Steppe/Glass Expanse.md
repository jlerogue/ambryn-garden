A catastrophe occurred here and in other places throughout the world simultaneously. A battle was being waged here at the time, and the desert sand was turned to glass as a result of what happened. There are no reports as to the specific nature of the catastrophe. Everybody who could have witnessed it is said to be dead.

Spirits of fallen soldiers, doctors, and wartime reporters linger.
