Vigil Heights is a permanent reminder of what was lost the day of the Bal Ascetican catastrophe known as [[1.Ambryn/Lore/The Blight\|The Blight]].

- Was once home to a school of healers who resided atop a plateau, but is now a memorial sight and graveyard although most of the graves are empty as the folk seemingly disappeared without a trace.
