- Tieflings are mostly immune, although some experience some minor effects.
- [[1.Ambryn/Lore/Species/Warforged\|Warforged]] immediately rust, burn, or fade away depending on their composition if they step into [[Locations/The Blightlands\|The Blightlands]].
- [[1.Ambryn/Lore/Species/Gem Dragonborn\|Gem Dragonborn]] seem completely immune, although they need to stay away from others for a period of several weeks after exposure to [[Locations/The Blightlands\|The Blightlands]]. They seem to carry some kind of magical residue within their scales after exposure.
