# Timeline of Events

**12th of Yrmorn, 465 NE**

●       **The Coral Corsair,** captained by a Triton named **Cassian** and Marin encounter a black metal ship while attacking a source of pollution, an aether-mining facility in the middle of the **Valucian Sea.**

●       Cassian falls over the side and Marin rescues him. They decide it’s time to visit their home city of **Bryn Chalice** again because it’s been a while. When they row to the area where they would normally dive to access their city, they see that the **Tritonlocke Torrent**, a mile-wide whirlpool that shuts off the city to outsiders is activated.

○        The two of them have made a habit of returning to visit the city once every two years since they first left the city together many years before.

●       _On the horizon, smoke signals emanate from the **God Gavel Arch**. Then, suddenly, a ferocious explosion which would come to be known as the Catastrophe erupts from the mainland._

●       Cassian and Marin are uninjured but are soon captured from the same metal ship that they had encountered earlier in the day.

**17th of Yrmorn, 467 NE**

●       **The Blightriders**, a group of Tieflings including Liminal and Redwood, have been determined to be immune to the effects of the Blight wearing dark goggles so they could see in the brightness accompanied by a human-esque person named Reynere. This was their deepest expedition and they were able to recover a large stone tablet. Nobody is able to make out the text on the tablet.

●       The captain of the expedition transforms and attacks the group on this trip.

●       Redwood and Liminal have a white pattern on their skin which is seemingly a new effect from their extended time in the Blight. Their eyes are now black with golden rings.

**12th of Yrmorn, 471 NE**

●       Raken visits his father, the Magus Emeritus of Hultonvault, in Hultonvault, a city of secrets built upon an archive of powerful artifacts with the purpose of protecting them. Raken’s father has requested that he be allowed to visit to assist in fixing a volatile gong-like artifact with a spiraling pattern on it that terminates in two lines. Raken is able to defuse the situation, although a mote of white light does escape the gong and enter a guard. Raken tells his father to keep an eye on the guard.

●       Raken has to wear a blindfold as he is led to the location of the artifact.

●       The artifact has the **Holy Symbol of Yf** on it — A serpentine dragon with a head on both sides facing opposite directions.

                        **9th of Yrmorn, 475 NE**

●      A Modron visits Marin at her place in Union Wharf to deliver a package. It is a blueprint with two lines that the Modron needs delivered to a Gem Dragonborn named Raken in Augurport. The Modron has some interesting ideas about how this job will work so Marin kindly explains, “Listen, I just want to explain to you that a Ranger isn’t the same thing as a mailman.”

○        Marin agrees to escort the Modron, whose name is Debug, to Augurport for the price of 30 gold.

●       Liminal is at a place called the Ready Dagger, which is a tavern on a boat in Union wharf. Half of it is just a concrete building.

●         A man throws up on Liminal. Also tells Liminal that there was a man downstairs in the pub shouting his name.

●        Liminal goes downstairs covered in vomit, bumps into someone who is upset by that fact, and gets into a fight.

●       The man who was shouting delivers a letter to Liminal.

●       The letter is from Interim Leader Delilah Jayce in Augurport. Tells Liminal that his friend, Redwood, is sick. Also provides 50 gp to Liminal so he can find a way to safely get to Auguport.

●       Liminal knows of a good ranger in town. He goes to Marin’s to hire her. He agrees to travel alongside Debug, too.

●       ​​Liminal shakes Debug’s hand using two fingers, which is something that is reserved for “best friends” in Debug’s culture, according to Debug.

●       Debug excitedly accepts the offer to become best friends but jokes that Liminal must be pretty lonely.

●       Marin says people can pay her by teaching her skills.

●       Debug responds by rapping to demonstrate his skills and promises to finish the song later.

●       The trip to Augurport will take 3 days.

●       Liminal mentions he has a home in Auguport.

●       Debug grabs the rag from Marin’s that Liminal used to clean vomit off himself. Stores it away as a souvenir.

**12Th of Yrmorn, 475 NE**

●      Raken takes job fixing Augurport’s cleansing stone. Hired by Interim Leader Delilah Jayce. He does so begrudgingly.

○      Knows he can fix the mechanical cogwork system. He looks at the system which consists of wound threads, some of them attached to rune stones, some of which aren’t glowing like they are supposed to. He can’t quite figure out how to solve the problem.

●       Reynere walks alongside Captain Angus and Delilaj Jayce after a training session in the courtyard.

●       Delilah Jayce asks Reynere to visit Raken to tell him that she would like an audience with him because she had a vision about him.

●       Reynere agrees to do it after her usual duty of checking the perimeter of the Blight.

●       Delilah Jayce asks Captain Angus to accompany her with a meeting with a Triton because she has an uneasy feeling about it.

○        Reynere catches a site of the Triton. He has a metal prosthetic leg and half his face is covered in a gold mask.

●       Reynere sees two bodies in the blight near the edge. One looks like Marin, who Reynere does not know, but the other looks familiar to her: it looks like Liminal with his hand, outstretched, reaching for the Eastern Gate.

●       Raken returns to his home, having decided his best approach is to ask his mom for repair advice.

○        She makes him tea using a device she’s working on called her “Tea for Two schematic.”

○        She doesn’t know how to help. Instead, sends him to a researcher in the Astral Belfry, Augurport’s Magus Emeritus.

○        She provides Raken with a letter of introduction.

●       Reynere arrives at Raken’s door. Overheard the entire conversation between Raken and his mom.

○        Reynere tells Raken that Delilah Jayce has requested an audience with him.

●        Liminal sees a familiar Black Ship in the Harbor as the travelers enter Augurport.

●       Raken also notices the ship, which must have arrived in town fairly recently. Its name is “The Maelstrom.”

○         Raken also notices Marin’s group and is drawn to the Modron as they are not of this plane and are a peculiarity to him.

●       A crowd moving through the area. When the crowd clears, the Modron is missing.

●       Marin notices the ship, too. She talks to Liminal and they realize they both have a history with the ship. They decide to get away.

●       Raken finds the scroll on the ground.

●       Liminal sees and recognizes Reynere.

●       He observes that Reynere has changed a bit since they last met in terms of demeanor. She’s friendlier, but not effortlessly so.

●       Reynere and Liminal discuss Redwood who talks about his wife and his Queen and mentions that he doesn’t have long to live. He wants Liminal to meet his wife or, at the very least, have a chance to say goodbye to him. Best case scenario, Liminal finds a way to save him.

●       Raken shouts after the crowd asking them if they have seen a “tiny robot.”

●       Raken wonders why the scroll the Modron dropped had his name on it.

●       The scroll itself is just two white lines.

●       Raken investigates the scroll further. He smells it and realizes it has been treated with chemicals. Raken can’t make out the precise nature of it. It’s also a new smell to him.

●       Reynere mentions to Marin that there’s a Triton in assembly with Interim Leader Delilah Jayce.

●       Reynere says she’s going to return to the Astral Belfry to keep watch over the meeting, since Angus had mentioned having a weird feeling about it.

●       They walk to an orchard in Augurport to a stone circle with a rune on it. The rune activates when Reynere stands on it and teleports them up to a matching stone circle and rune on the floating island above Augurport known as the Astral Belfry.

●       In front of them is a large Cathedral, containing a place where the council of eight meet, barracks where city guard sleeps, research libraries, and a research hospital, among other features.

●       Liminal has looked uncomfortable since getting to Augurport but especially seems nervous standing in front of Redwood’s room. Reynere picks up on this and leads the way into the room for him. Liminal follows closely behind.

●       Reynere checks Redwood’s vitals. He’s only sleeping.

●       “I’m just sleeping. Dreaming about you a bit. Dreaming about flowers. Can you get the curtain? It’s so…well…anyway…it’s too late for you to save me. But at least you can meet my wife, Lim. I want you to meet my wife, Lim.”

●       Then he says he’ll go get her. He falls asleep. When he wakes up, he tells them there’s a plant in the Blight that can cure him.

●       He turns over and the back of his skull, as though it is made from clay, moves and undulates. It begins to talk to them. This is the “wife” Redwood is referring to.

●       A creature comes crashing through the window. When it does, Redwood’s neck starts stretching and his face starts to swell. His head pulls away from his body and begins to hover, as wings formed from his flesh flap to hold him aloft. Jaw unhinges.

**Val Arrives in Augurport, they All Gather in the Astral Belfry**

Delilah Jayce and Malik enter the room being chased by a large, white Bat creature. Malik says hello and goodbye, a smirk on his face, to Liminal and Marin, before diving out the window.

Val, an air genasi, has come to the Astral Belfry to visit the Magus Emeritus and gain access to Augurport’s large archive of information.

He enters Augurport through the port and stops into a bar called The Pillaging Poet. It’s very, very crowded. As he sits in the crowded bar, he hears travelers complaining about the lack of a day night cycle. It should be the night of a full moon, but the constant light of the Blight blocks it out. Normally, on the first night of a Full Moon, a temple would apparate within Augurport, too, formed in the moonlight but that hasn’t happened for ten years which is a shame because there are flowers that grow within the temple that have curative properties.

Val pieces together that nobody seems to know what the large, black metal ship in the port is except that it’s called the Maelstrom and that the Triton that Captained it had headed toward the Astral Belfry. One person mentions he overheard something about a meeting with Interim Leader Delilah Jayce. Some say he’s a Revantum Nova emissary. He believes his old friend, Marin, might have mentioned something about the ship in the past. It “kinda rings a bell,” he thinks.

Other ships he recognizes includes one owned by a sky captain and war veteran called Captain Pellius Avhoste. The war began 100 years ago, ended about 20 years ago. He’s gone a bit rogue, and is a celebrated pirate but his decision to hire a mercenary by the name of Kagan the Screamhunter has some people wondering what he might be up to these days when he’s out at sea. Rumors abound. Neither of these people are in the tavern at the moment.

He also saw the ship of a former Canto Elysium employee named Shaman Avarian, a foremost expert in wizard-assisted sea travel. Their ship is called The Sea of Swords.

Then there is also the ship of a local woman who has spent a lot of time in Union Wharf. Runs mining operations to various islands and scavenger sights named Ellis Manistrad.

It seems strange to Val that there are so many important sailors gathered at this location.

Val has had meetings like this one before with little luck in terms of securing access to archives or information he is looking for. Even though he knows this Magus Emeritus personally, he takes his time going to the meeting because he expects disappointment.

He notes the warforged in the Orchard of the World Tree below the Astral Belfry seem to be working harder than usual. Val activates the rune to the Belfry. Before any of this, though, he gets a bit lost and sidetracked and wanders through the market. He sees a cart called “The Sword Wagon” and a place called “Boot O’Malleys Hireling Hirer for Hire Talent Placement Agency.” Val has seen this franchise of budget mercenary guilds in other towns before. He’s heard of The Sword Wagon before and knows it’s run by a traveling Owlin named Pinochle Cabana who doesn’t speak common very well and has a tendency of calling all adventuring gear “swords.” Val refers to it as the “Stabbin’ Wagon,” which isn’t an uncommon colloquialism.

As Val looks up at the Astral Belfry, he sees a Triton dive out the window of the hospital wing, fall for a bit, and then float away assisted by winged boots. The Astral Belfry is about 1,000 feet off the ground. Clouds roll under it, but not through it as there is a magical aura that helps control weather around the Astral Belfry.

Val uses the rune stone and makes his way to the library. It becomes clear that something is amiss when he hears chaos ringing through the halls of the main building.

When Val arrives, he sees that Interim Leader Delilah Jayce’s arm has gone totally white below the elbow. This is a result of an attack that has struck both her and Raken. Liminal recognized the attack, to a degree, because he had seen similar motes of light strike both his captain and Redwood in the Blight.

Eventually the group dispatches the foes. They determine that the curses that were placed on Delilah Jayce and Raken isn’t immediately pressing. They also investigated the Blight beasts and realized that the leather-like skin on the large bat creature has a magical property.

The white motes of light, Reynere recalls, appeared to have anguished faces in them as they darted through the air. Marin has never seen a creature like the ones they just fought.

“Oh my gosh, Val, it’s so glad to see you. I’m so happy to be back in community with you after all this time,” says Marin to Val.

“Marin, have you ever encountered anything like this in your travels?”

“Nope, this is very weird.”

Marin then introduces everybody to Val. “I don’t really know why he’s here.”

“I was just going to the library and this crazy bat thing flew out of nowhere.”

Delilah Jayce then addresses them after realizing Marin is the ranger that brought Liminal there. Marin tells her about the Modron that accompanied them as well as the document.

“Anyway, stop me if…well..I tend to go on.”

“Ah, a Modron! I had nothing to do with that but I do love them. They don’t always agree with our practices in divination but I do enjoy their company.”

“This one was a musician, and it was wonderful being around him.”

“I’ve been meeting more and more of them lately. Some believe there are multiple realities that you can calculate based on what happens in this one. They disagree with divination but they do think that we could calculate where and when things will happen in the future if we know more about what has happened in other realities. I am being so rude, though, going on and on about Modrons. Raken! I invited you here, you must be wondering why! Reynere, thank you for bringing him. Raken, I dreamt of you! Not in, like, a romantic way to be clear but, well, in a way that seemed very important. I would like to talk about that but we should address the fact that multiple curses are going around and I would just hate to perish while I am serving in the role of Interim Leader as we search out the fourth verse.”

“Del, we should talk about curing your curse more than anything, since you bring it up.”

Most people wouldn’t dare Delilah Jayce Del, not that she’d mind.

“What is that, Rey?”

“The curse”

“Oh, right! Well, my reports suggest that, in his final days, Redwood had insisted through dream acquired knowledge that there was a cure out in the Blight but you and Liminal are the only ones who can travel out there and I woudn’t have you doing that just the two of you. Not after what happened to you before.”

Delilah Jayce then points at Val. “I don’t know you, but I do know that we had a visitor scheduled for today. Are you the relapsed scholar, I heard about? Val? Do I call you Val?”

“Yes, I was supposed to talk to the Magus Emeritus.”

“Yes, I am so sorry. Today has gotten away from us a little bit. We weren’t expecting to be attacked and I was organizing meetings all day thinking everything would be all set. Magus [Gavel] Presiope should be around. Maybe he went to hide somewhere when he heard the scuffle, not that he’s not a brave man. He’s just a prudent one and he knows we need him and trusts the rest of us can keep ourselves safe. I did insist that he keep his precious brain safe if there is ever any danger.”

“I can come back,” says Val.

“No, no, no, that won’t be necessary. He’s probably just hiding beneath the floorboards in the grand archive.”

“So, do you dream a lot of stuff?”

“Oh yes, it’s very important to us. We also improvise songs and utilize dice and card, but dream is probably the most natural medium for divination. Did you not learn that in school? I know they do downplay it a bit.”

“Well, I did take Intro to Div, but it was a while ago. And Div 150.”

Raken mentions he has a letter of referral from his mom, Hera, and Delilah Jayce excitedly welcomes the opportunity to help him. “I can get him, if you’d like, and he’d be happy to help! If you prefer to go yourself, though, or alongside Val, you can probably just knock on the floorboards in the stacks and call his name. He’ll come out. He just needs to know it’s safe. Again, it’s not that he’s not brave. He’s just following orders to take the utmost precaution. Lim, are you doing okay? All things considered?”

“No. Thanks.”

“I know there’s a natural friction between us because I sent you on the mission that lead to all this.”

“You don’t say.”

“I want you to know that when the counsel gathered and voted about whether or not we’d send anybody out on the expedition, that I requested that the final decision as to whether or not you enter the Blight should be left to the individuals of your group. I was ignored. They also didn’t consider Reynere a full person, despite my pleadings, so they probably thought I was being irrational.”

“Yeah, speaking of Reynere, are we going to ignore the cute little nicknames? What’s that about? Are you two…?” Liminal makes a rude gesture implying that Reynere and Delilah Jayce might romantically entangled.

Delilah Jayce looks awkward in response to this. Reynere notices and knows that Delilah Jayce struggles with topics like this.

Reynere gets into Liminal’s personal space and puts her face inches away from his. “You treat Leader Jayce with respect.”

“The same amount that you’d treat any other person,” Delilah Jayce says, blushing.

A devilish grin crosses Liminal’s face.

“Don’t you mean Del, Reynere? Sorry, I mean Rey.”

“She can call me Del. It’s fine. I like it.” Says Delilah Jayce.

“It’s Leader Delilah Jayce to you, though, Liminal.”

“I’m okay with Del, really. Again, treat me like anybody else.”

“I’ll use your title if you tack “Captain” onto the beginning of my name.”

Delilah Jayce pivots to a new conversation. “Marin, how much do I owe you?”

“The Modron already paid 30 so it’s all okay.”

“No, please. What can I pay you?”

“Whatever you think is fair.”

“What are your services worth?”

“Let’s let Liminal decide.”

“Captain Liminal, what is your review of her services?”

“Well, that Modron wasn’t an easy passenger to have with us. They have very special needs.”

“I’m so sorry. I know everybody is different. I would have loved to travel with a Modron but I can see how it could be taxing.”

“Is 100 gold really the cap?”

Liminal figures out, accurately, that 100 isn’t the cap but Delilah Jayce doesn’t like to offend people with gross sums of money and is never sure what she’s allowed to do or when she should resist her impulse to be overly generous. His history with her and his insight into people leaves him with the feeling that he could persuade her for more. He grins, knowing he has some leverage.

“Well, gosh, what do you think, Marin? I think it was worth at least 150, 175?”

Feeling okay that the money is coming from Government Coffers, Marin says those numbers are fine, even though she is accustomed to making very, very little.

They end up settling on 200 gold. Delilah Jayce just asks that the prices stay between them. They report 100 to accounting, basically, but “they pay me monthly for my role here, but they also give me food and a place to live, so I don’t really need much and have plenty to spare so how about I make up the difference?” She pulls 100 gold out of a pouch.

This exchange makes Liminal feel just a bit dirty, as though he’s acted a bit against his own nature and ignored his conscience.

While all of this is going on, Raken is poking at the creatures on the ground.

Delilah Jayce became the Interim Leader when her best friend, the previous leader and Fourth Verse, left her in charge when she went on a trip to Union Wharf (at the time, the city was called Port Solace) but the Fourth Verse perished on that trip. Had the role of Advisor and through a series of technicalities, has become the Regent Leader (I think that’s the term).

“So, to revisit it, a portion of us are definitely cursed,” says Delilah Jayce.

“This the one you have to go into the Blight to fix?” asks Raken.

“Well, my vision did see you in the Blight with, well, you know how some visions are just dreams? Nonsense? And it’s hard to know for sure which is which. My dream had you, Raken, and the rest of you in the Blight. And Raken, you had a flower in your hand and you started to jot down notes in a notebook. I didn’t know what it meant at the time but now that I remember what was in the notebook, and when I consider our current predicament, well, I think you might discover a way for people to travel the Blight safely. Not just Tieflings or Reynere. What’s more, I believe that your religious education and conviction, with Yf in particular, I feel like it will play a role in all of this. I have nightmares of another situation that doesn’t go well that looks very much like this dream, though. Would you like me to read your palm?”

“No, I’m good,” replies Raken, visibly upset and embarrassed that she brought up his religion because people usually don’t mention it and it’s a point of ridicule for many as Yf is often considered a fictional Eidolon. Delilah Jayce tries to assure him that she was sincere and she doesn’t discredit the existence of Yf. The entire exchange is awkward.

She pivots again, “so, how about those Modrons, eh?” Raken laughs.

Eventually they wrap up. “I will retreat for now and leave you all to catch up. I get the sense that there are some relationships here, between you. Commander Angus, will you come with me? There are some issues I want to discuss with you about resources and, perhaps, an expedition.”

As she goes to walk away, Val stops her. “Ma’am, excuse me, that other vision you have that doesn’t go well, can you tell me about it? What do you see?”

“Well, I saw…” and she points to Liminal and Marin “In one of them, I saw these two crawling on their stomachs toward Augurport, succumbing to something at the edge of the Blight near the South East gate, just at the edge of town. Hope long gone from their eyes and they ceased to be. I’ve seen the rest of you, torn skin from bone while a bouquet of flowers lay on the ground.”

The group looks horrified.

“I am sorry!” Delilah Jayce quickly responds. “I get excited about dreams and visions and I get just as excited about the former as I do the latter but people put a lot of stock in what I say and that can get them a bit, well, on edge, and I see that this has happened here. So, I will leave you all to catch up. I feel like that is a good first step, since comradery will likely lead to better results in our future. I love you all.”

Reynere chuckles.

“Rey, my dear, you know we’re all so proud of you here, right? And grateful. I apologize for your earliest days.”

Reynere says “Of course. I love you, Del.” Reynere’s gaze is averted and she seems embarrassed.

“and Captain Liminal, the gratitude we feel for Reynere, we feel it for you, too. But I keep stopping myself from my own departure. Let’s chalk it up to your collective charisma.”

And then she finally does leave.

Whenever Delilah Jayce and Reynere speak, Angus looks as though he is trying to figure out the nature of their relationship. Even after all these years, he still can’t manage to do it.

Raken offers them space in his home to stay the night. “It’s not the biggest place in the world but it’s cozy and my mom does cook. Her bread is, well, it’s 50/50 but, you know, I’m feeling quite good about the streak she’s been on lately so I think it’s gonna be a good meal.”

“That sounds fun,” says Liminal. “You still remember how to have fun, Reynere, or have you forgotten that over the past eight years?”

“I’ve only since learned how to have fun and I’m finding it hard to access right now,” she says to Liminal.

“Apparently you haven’t learned how to pull a stick out of your ass.”

“Anyway, Val, these are my friends,” says Marin.

“Nice crew. I see you’re doing that whole found family thing again.”

“No, we just met so, I, well…” replies Marin.

“It does sound nice to go to Raken’s abode,” says Reynere.

“It overlooks the sea, as well, so maybe that will be more accommodating than other options for the seafaring folk,” says Raken.
