| - | We get to the bottom and there’s a stone slab that Cliff knows is a trap door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| - | We drop down 7-8 feet to the ground; we’re standing on a narrow walkway that would be tricky for Loxodon to walk on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| - | Cliff knows there are creatures that look like Scritchm Stractcham. They’re created in a hurried ritual from a dying person, to seek vengeance.  It’s basically someone committing their soul to a shadowy spectral form to pursue vengeance. It’s a rare Carnathi magic that’s banned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| - | Finneas has handled cases where people have been found with material components and educational materials to cast such a spell.  It creates creatures of vengeance who are not cured when they cure the object of their anger; their soul just doesn’t jive with its incorporeal form.  They’re creatures of madness.  Some argue that’s not the case, but evidence suggests it is.  They can phase through walls and take on the form of water.                                                                                                        |

It’s a shard that one can use to bind elementals.  She tells us she’s only seen it been used for bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| - | This is how airships were invented.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| - | Finn kicks the shard out of the fire, it slides under the bed.  He goes to pick it up, and finds it and a pocket watch.  There’s a date etched on the watch; the hands match the date.  There’s a sheet of glass on the cover, behind that there is a detailed drawing of a tiefling with their arm around Pinot.  Finn snaps the watch closed and hands it to Pinot.  She walks away a bit.  She’s seen the watch but never the engraving.  Rumour usually has the watch with him.  She didn’t know that the watch didn’t keep time.                   |
| - | The date on the outside was the date Pinot and Rumour met.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| - | Kwame wanted to keep checking on the shrunken elephants.  If they have a pulse (they don’t). Faces twisted in horror.  Stiff.  Finds a fanny pack w/ a warrant in it? Does not see ghosts like the last time he saw dead people. Puts the bodies face down/tries to fix their faces/close their eyes/make them look as dignified as possible. Comes back to group. Kwame glanced at the warrant; very elegant writing.  Warrant for Cliff’s arrest.  Writing pressed hard where Cliff’s name was written. SIGNED BY VERITAS DI VITALI, chief of police. |
| - | Cliff looks nervous. Hears a sloshing noise and a few drops of water on his neck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| - | The spooky sewer monster wraps around Cliff’s neck & drags Cliff out into the sewer out of the room. Cliff is struggling w/ the sewer monster. He gets out of its grip, I heal him, Pinot sneak attacks using rapier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| - | Kwame takes out guard’s sword and tries to revenge the guards. Not looking too good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| - | Scritchm catches Cliff by surprise and totally encapsulates him.  It starts sucking the life out of him.  Finn is wondering if it has vengeance against Cliff.  Kwame was ready to punch the creature.  He does.  Half damage taken by Cliff.  Finn poisons the creature.  Pinot inspires herself and kills it.  She stabs it w/ rapier where she thinks its heart would be.  It falls to the ground, puddle at her feet.  Pinot is looking a bit crazed.                                                                                               |
