### 

The Parable of the Songbird.

    On the outskirts of Augurport, in the shade of the world tree, there lived a humble family of three. A cleric of Sybil Aevitus, a devotee of Davorr, and a faithless child happy devoted to his chores.   Ordinary in their ways with the same routine every day: breakfast at eight, dinner at five, and a quick story to ease into bedtime.   One night the child skipped the ritual of story. “I am very tired and have to do chores in the morning.”   He dreamt of a nightingale that was also a skylark. He dreamt of evils found in both light and dark.   The child awoke knowing without needing proof that his mother was gone and there was something on the roof.   It was a nightingale, vision alight on something unseen, but was this the same skylark the child saw in his dreams?   The nightingale then perched upon the sill like a sentry guarding the room. In distant rolling mist, the shaded visage of ends beginning is spotted by a watchful moon.   “Beware, beware, the things out there,” sings the nightingale.   The skylark still sensed its presence as it slipped from the light. The child couldn’t sleep, now permanently aware of the monster called Plainsight.   **_(You turn the page and discover that parts of the book have been ripped out.

_**  The mind tired, time dilated, reason expired, and rhyme dissipated. The father left the next day to search for his wife. The child begged him not to go, but his request was refused. When the father closed the door, the child knew with impossible certainty that he would not returned. The child dragged his body to his room and waited for night. But with the same impossible certainty as before, he knew that he should fear something in the mirror. And the armoire. And under the bed. And the skylark knew, too. And the nightingale sensed a presence skulking in the daytime. “Hide, child, hide, from the horrors inside.” And the child became permanently aware of the one they call the Dreadmime. The child made to flee, but was greeted at the door by twilight and the one they call Plainsight. “Beware, beware, the things out there.” He ran back inside. “Hide child, hide.” He ran outside. “Beware.” He ran inside. “Hide.” He ran to the library from his room, locked the door. Among the books a sanctuary, then a tomb where the child remains, quothe the skylark, “forevermore.”   **_(You turn the page again and discover that there is a series of illustrations. The final two pages of the book are left blank)._**

### Purpose

A small book found in a lair constructed by giants as well as the penumbral witch **Ecliptis Meridia** which has been modified slightly to serve her purposes. It was originally written by a cleric of **Valivale** to encourage young members of the clergy to continue their dedication to the inherent power in uncovering truths and keeping secrets. The story wasn't effective in that regard, but was exceedingly useful for the Penumbral Witch.   For starters, its design was one that, while eerie, mostly appeared innocent. Its ominous tone implying something secret; hints that would help those who were invited to the witch's lair navigate safely. Invisible imagery would appear to those blessed by the witch, further aiding the navigation of the complex and dangerous labyrinth.
