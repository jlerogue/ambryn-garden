She clutched the stone tight to her chest as she watched the ship sink. This was the third ship in as many years. 

How could she, daughter of the semi-charmed Dread Jedd Walker, have such rotten luck? She no longer wondered. 

The answer lied in a deal gone sour, a deal that had granted her dad a life of fortune. The stone meant nothing, not really, but she found herself attached to it just the same. 

It was an oval of amber, perfectly smooth, but ultimately imperfect — a blue hair was visible, suspended in the stone’s core. 

She’d never met anybody in-person with blue hair, except once. When she was a child, a Triton came on shore to meet her dad. 

She went into another room with her mother. Together, they pressed against the door, trying to hear what the meeting was about. 

Her father had never mentioned it, but a Triton coming ashore was rare, and that came with a connotation of importance. But when they pressed their ear to the door, they heard nothing. 

They looked through the keyhole, curious, and saw nothing but a deep blue void. Her father never explained. He looked as though he might a few times, and he insisted that he wanted to but couldn’t do so just yet. 

She trusted her father enough to trust that she’d find out one day. That trust is why she and her mom left suddenly, without explanation, to sail into the sea the same week the town was destroyed. 

Multiple other townsfolk did the same, but only a dozen plus the crew, since the request was, on the face of it, asinine. But Dread Jedd, not yet known by that name, had provided much for the town. Treasures from all around. 

Dread Jedd engaged in what he called ethical piracy. He wrote the pirate code that would be used after the town’s destruction. After that day, Jedd changed. 

He met with the newly appointed Exarch Finch and was appointed Admiral. 

He spent the next three years ravaging foreign ships. 

Then he left, without crew, aboard a ship he shouldn’t have been able to sail alone, in the middle of a bright night. The mist glowed under the full moon. 

Jess barely had time to see him off. He hadn’t told her he was going. By the time she got home and saw the stone and the note, it was too late to reach him. 

Jess spent the next year finding a crew. Some members of her dad’s crew were happy to join.
