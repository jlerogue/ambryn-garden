There was a woman who either could not or would not sleep, not that it mattered if the exhaustion was deliberate. Sure, she’d nod off from time to time, but then she’d think about her god, to whom she owed so much. She should be serving them, and she should be bringing others into the flock.

The less sleep she got, the more spiritual she became. She wandered through the streets, smiling. A Karnathi priest remarked that the smile was all that separated the woman from the walking dead that served the city. When his snide comment became less and less hyperbolic, he felt immense guilt. He took up a charity in her name.

People gathered in his modest church near the enormous statue of ash and remains in the town square. They didn’t talk about what must be done. Instead they spoke about what could be done or what should be done. It was voluntary and it was a matter of care, although some might have been busy bodied, nosey types throughout their life.

The woman showed up at the church, wondering why people were so wholly devoted to the god of death. There is enough time in their lives for them to pay their dues to other eidolon, too, surely? A kindly old woman slowly approached, a compassionate smile on her face. She was going to reiterate what the woman had just said to the flock, as it made sense, and would serve her well. Before she could, the young devotee collapsed.

A funeral was held the next day. Her body wasn’t committed to population of undead who served the city in their death, nor were her ashes set into the statue. Instead, Karn let her rest.

We can only pray she stays asleep.
