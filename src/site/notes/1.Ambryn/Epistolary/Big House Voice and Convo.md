Maybe Big House wants to hear her sing. (Does Abi want to sing?)

Or maybe:

You haven’t even heard me sing.

So? I’m sure you’re very talented kid but this business isn’t about talent. I’m interested in your look. And I have an inkling yowuh..lineage might be of some value. Tell me, hwat do you know about your lineage Ms. Naztali?”

——-

“I suppose it doesn’t mattuh hwatchu know. Showuh is funny how someone else might just know a bit more about hyur uwuhjin, idnt it?”

“Nowuh, I reckoned you would want to know mowuh, but I’m a propah biuhzsuhniss mayuhn, Ms. Naztali and I’m awlreddeh givin’ so muhuch uhway fuh free so I hope yuh don’t think muh ehnuhthang luhyiss theyan uh gen-yu-Ihne gentuhmuhn, yuh undahstayund? 

That’s all, is it?

That’sahl I rully want tuh keh-myoon-uh—kayut. Um a deeseeuhnt felluh. Ahh hope you rehmehmbuh theyat down the line if I evuh need a favor. Rehsuhprociteh mah deeyuh. Nowd eff yuh unduhstayuhnd.

So what’s the plan?

I’ll talk to my people. Soon people won’t even mention the name Ms. Lady Martini. Closest they’ll get is wondering who that chump change broad was that used to headline the big casinos and classy bars before your name went up on the marquee. “What was her name again?” they’ll say. “The shrill bird that warmed the mic until a real powerhouse dynamo could take the stage?” We’re gonna change lives, darling, and we aren’t going to let anybody stand in our way.

“I have the capital to assist, Ms. Naztali. And other...resources.”

Accent = Accsyent

Shore. 

Hw sounds. “Hwat” “Hwell” “Hwhy.”
