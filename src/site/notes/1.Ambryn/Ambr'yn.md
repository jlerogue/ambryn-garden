An isolated dream world, real as any other, wrenched from the ancient nightmares of a perished plane. Entwined gods slumber in the heart of the world. They hold tight through tortured screams and throes of agony. Their creations careen toward avoidable cataclysm. Their embrace tightens. They remember. One drifts deeper. She dreams of love. A lullaby about hope returns to her. She dreams of salvation. One stirs toward consciousness. She dreams of love. An ancient animosity crashes back. She dreams of vengeance. And the veil between worlds begins to fade.
