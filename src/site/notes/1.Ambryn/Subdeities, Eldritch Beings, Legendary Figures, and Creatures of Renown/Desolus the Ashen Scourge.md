- Real name is Blitz Tusken

- Trapped in a crystal prison

- Made a deal with a witch while he was a general in Karn in order to save his beloved.

- Failed to hold up his end of bargain and became a devil in service to the witch. Killed in war before he could do what he needed to do.

- Eventually captured by that witch’s sister and imprisoned.

- Has a deal with the current archbishop. The archbishop wants to be empowered for a revenge plot. The devil wants the archbishop to be in charge so he can have people “pledge their heart, body, and soul” to the nation in the interest of unity.

- Devil can’t promise to kill Archon because he has already made that deal with another.

- Confidentiality clause means he can’t reveal that. Instead, he’ll simply say “consider it done.”

-  Can’t just made Fadir the king.
	- “Conflict of interests.”

- The devil was okay with not being freed because a “powerful ally” would eventually do that for him anyway. He’s immortal, so he can be pation.
	- He didn’t specify who the ally was.

- The group doesn’t specifically know why Archon’s men are in the area, so perhaps they are the ally.

- The devil’s story also revealed to the group that the two witches do not get along.
