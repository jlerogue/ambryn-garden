Gods learning humility, the kids who were born the day the world ended. These souls will be put into new places. But not all who come through are divine. Some are just kind. Champions for another life time. The gods, once mortal again, will recognize them all.
Reincarnations of old characters.

Some believe a pocket dimension exists where the Bestowed must go to learn humility. 

All Bestowed are killed and revived in the attainment of their power. Some also believe that souls who didn’t have the means to fulfill their destiny exist here before they are reincarnated. 

This could all be bunk. 

Some don’t believe in destiny. 

Souls also mostly don’t remember their previous lives, and never remember the afterlife. 

The exception, supposedly, is The Reprisal, although they have to hone that ability and it is less like remembering it and more like learning it.
