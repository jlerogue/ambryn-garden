**Summary**
Two people met at a wishing well as another world came to an end. It was an old meeting place of theirs. One, a soldier, the other a tavernkeep. As everything ignited in a ball of fire, they cast a coin into the well. They never woke, but their consciousnesses stayed together for eternity, sequestered in a plane away from all the other planes. Together, they dream up the world. It’s built from their hopes, fears, memories, and imagination. But if they came from a world so acquainted with destruction, does that mean that their memories can only lead to the same fate? This is a fear that has risen in the especially religious as of late.

**The Story**

“We were born in the end times, but we lived our lives to the fullest," said the old drunk. Around him were a half-dozen of his closest buddies. Their families, long lost.“And we did what we could,” said another.

The barkeep wondered if that was true. Did they do what they could? Though the world, which was scorched and scarred, persisted its peoples knew it wouldn’t last. The damage had been done. The reckoning was nigh. Of course, impending death doesn’t mean life stops. 

There, at the end of the world, people were still being born. In the split-second before oblivion, a dozen newborns were animated with the spark of life. 

When it ended, a young woman called Amara was holding the thoughts of these barely-borns in her mind, not knowing the quantity but knowing of their inevitability. She imagined their souls being drawn to the ether, as though they hadn’t yet been bound to this dimension.

Then she thought about the plausibility of other dimensions as she stared down the wishing well where she had met her soulmate, a soldier. 

They hadn’t seen each other since the war. When word of the inevitable cataclysm came, she wrote her beloved. 

She wasn’t sure if it was sentiment, hope, or duty that brought her to this moment but whatever it was, it moved her. 

Even if it all turned out to be silly, it felt like a fitting resolution. She couldn’t have known it was actually a beginning. 

“Hey,” came a soft voice. 

Across the well stood a spirit. It was her Mariam, the soulmate. 

“You came!” said Amara. She then pulled a coin from her pocket.

”You kept it?" asked the spirit. The young woman smiled and nodded. “Quick! Make a wish!”
