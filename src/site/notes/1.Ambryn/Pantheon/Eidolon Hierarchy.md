It all started with the Entwined, [Amara and Mariam](/w/ambr-yn-jacklerogue89/a/amara-and-mariam-myth), the Dreamers. Ideas and reality flowed from them, down tiers, all the way to the Bestowed, champions of Eidolons who were given portfolios of their own. Tragically, some were corrupt and became Abberant Eidolons. Here’s an incomplete list that I will fill out with time. If you have questions about any specific Eidolon, let me know — I have the information but have yet to publish it. You can also contribute Eidolons of your own, or make changes or alterations to the preexisting ones, or the behaviors of their followers.  

## The Dreamers

Mariam and Amara, locked in an embrace somewhere in the core of the world.  

## The Cognitions

    The Cognitions are incomprehensibly large dragons that soar through the cosmos. Their portfolios are vast and creation fell on their mighty and capable shoulders. When their focus turned to the thinning veil that protects their plane from interference, they came together to create a new generation of Eidolons. Some were created directly from their individual domains. Others were created in collaboration as these new Eidolons would have to straddle the borders between the domains of the cognitions to effectively wield their powers. The three cognitions are:  
Yr – High Eidolon of Time 
Ym – High Eidolon of the Abstract 
Ys – High Eidolon of the Material  

*Some say there is a fourth cognition named Yf, but nobody has found any evidence to support that idea.*  

(Yr = Year = Time, Ym = Immaterial = Abstract, Ys = Is = To Be, Yf = What if = Alternate Timelines)  

## The Beheld

    The Beheld are the strongest Eidolons to commune with mortals. On some occasions, they even walk the world through the use of avatars.   • Kahz, of Ym and Yr, Eidolon of Death • Veldir, of Ys, Eidolon of Elemental Balance • Brin Atomos, of Ym, Eidolon of Sentience and the Mind • Kas’Lienne, of Ys and Yr, Eidolon of Passion, Pain, Penance, and Progress • Halia the Traveler, of Yr and Ym, Eidolon of Misdirection, Change, Confusion, Trickery • Xotlmark, of Ys, Community, Prosperity, and Harvest • Rondo, of Yr, Eidolon of Cycles and Anima, of Ym, Eidolon of Soul. Bound to one another, their thoughts intertwined, their emotions separate. • Eos, of Ym and Ys, Eidolon of Arcana • Ultur Dinn, of Ys, Eidolon of Beasts • Iman Amano, of Ys and Ym, Eidolon of Expression and Inspiration • Amn’aniah, of Ym and Yr, Eidolon of Polarity and Balance • Sehtar, of Ym, Yr, and Ys, Eidolon of Cosmic Law in the Court of the Divine • Wundar, of Ym and Ys, Eidolon of Worthiness and Envy • Taratenga, of Yr, Ys, and Ym, Eidolon of Recreation, Sport, and Honor • Itar, of Ys, Eidolon of Fortune and Luck • Dahl Qybris, of Ym and Yr, Eidolon of the Spirit and the Surreal • Yna, of Ym and Yr, Eidolon of Visions and Dreams • Ix’Aldir, of Ys, Eidolon of Void and Portals • Ciara, of Yr and Ys, Eidolon of Nature and Growth • Mattis, of Yr and Ys, Eidolon of Creation and Entropy • Edea, of Ym and Ys, Eidolon of Gravity, Attraction, Bonds, and Love. • Roxmos, of Yr and Ym, Eidolon of Judgement, Measurement, and Crossroads • Jung Varis, of Yr and Ym, Eidolon of Wisdom and Madness • Lusk, of Ys, Yr, and Ym, Eidolon of Avatars and Aspects • Weis, of Yr and Ym, Eidolon of Communication, Solidarity, and Bonds  

## The Bestowed

    The bestowed are mortals who earned the favor of The Beheld and subsequently ascended to a lesser level of Eidolon. Some of them serve as proof that the Beheld make mistakes. Or do they?   • Axion, Eidolon of Trade, bestowed by Xotlmark • Osbegosk, Eidolon of Grief and Sentiment, bestowed by Edea and Mattis • Zashadin, Aberrant Eidolon of Conquest, bestowed by Xotlmark • Sybil Aevitus, Eidolon of Prophecy, bestowed by Rondo and Anima. Only Eidolon to be murdered. • Aion, Eidolon of Invention and Desperation, bestowed by Amn’aniah, Itar, and Iman Amano. This is the only time three Eidolons have lent power to a single mortal’s ascension. • Kyr’Lienne, Eidolon of Hedonism and Depravity, bestowed by Kas’Lienne • Valivale, Eidolon of Truth and Secrets, bestowed by Amn’aniah • Kyndarr, Eidolon of Strategy and Vainglory, bestowed by Halia the Traveler • Tusulla, Aberrant Eidolon of Murder • Rhiton, Eidolon of Storm, bestowed by Kahz • Davorr, Eidolon of Logic and Mathematics, bestowed by Eos • Cadis, Eidolon of Song, Rhythm, Poetry, and Rhyme, bestowed by Kas’Lienne • Normak, Eidolon of Humor, Tension, and Levity, bestowed by Iman Amano • Mytra Deggi, Eidolon of Humility, Pride, Introspection, and Shame, bestowed by Kas’Lienne • Tiliquori, Aberrant Eidolon of Torture and Massacres, bestowed by Taratenga • Cye, Eidolon of Longing, Yearning, and Gratitude, bestowed by Yna • Vames, Eidolon of Conflict and Trial, bestowed by Mattis • Dysmis, Eidolon of Fiction and Charitable Lies, bestowed by Jung Varis • Dakdia, Aberrant Eidolon of Wellness and Delusion, bestowed by Roxmos • Leera Yxione, Eidolon of the Past, Histories, and Legacy, bestowed by Jung Varis  

## Aspects of Elsewhere

    Deities from other planes have been crossing through the threshold. Their motives are unclear, but they are merely aspects, weakened versions of their full selves. These are the Aspects of Elsewhere that have been encountered by mortals.   • Bahamut • Tiamat • Umberlee • Savras • Tymora  

## Collected Conscious Avatars

  To endure, and mitigate risk, Sybil Aevitus split their being into six parts. Two parts are bonded to the soul of the Reprisal. The remaining four bond to the souls of the Verses. It is possible that other Eidolons have taken similar precautions.   • The Reprisal, aspect of Sybil Aevitus • First Verse, aspect of Sybil Aevitus • Second Verse, aspect of Sybil Aevitus • Third Verse, aspect of Sybil Aevitus • Fourth Verse, aspect of Sybil Aevitus
