Amara and Mariam, the Eternally Bonded, are the souls from which all life is born. They are the dreamers, perpetually sleeping in loving embrace.   They were the first to exist, before matter, time, or the abstract.

As they turned their memories over and over, gently holding the amber of everything in their fingers. Something stirred. Emotions sublimated. What was to happen, would happen, and they couldn’t stop it. They decided, in the first moments, the instants before time, that they would treasure one another.   So they created the **Cognitions** , incomprehensibly large dragon **Eidolons** known as Ym, Yr, and Ys. Manifestations of their dreams, aspects of their combined essence.
