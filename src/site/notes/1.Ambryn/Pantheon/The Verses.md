- When the Eidolon [[1.Ambryn/Pantheon/Sybil Aevitus\|Sybil Aevitus]] was murdered while walking the physical world, their soul is split up into six parts. Two parts reincarnate in a person called the Reprisal. Four Parts are split among individuals called the Verses. When one of these people die, their fraction of the [[Sybil Soul\|Sybil Soul]] reincarnates in another, although the person isn't necessarily aware of this, and the [[clergy of Sybil Aevitus\|clergy of Sybil Aevitus]] or the current Reprisal and Verses will search the world to find them.
