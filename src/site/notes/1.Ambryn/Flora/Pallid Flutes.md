- A flower that grows exclusively in the [[Locations/Regions/Velum Custodia/Bal Ascetica/Settlements/Augurport/Lunargown Temple\|Lunargown Temple]].
- Effects of consumption:
	- Temporary muteness.
	- Emotions manifest as spirits and spectral images appear around the temple like projections.
		- These projections intermingle with other projections if multiple projections are present, regardless of whose emotions conjured them.
- The petals lose their efficacy immediately after they are removed from the temple.
